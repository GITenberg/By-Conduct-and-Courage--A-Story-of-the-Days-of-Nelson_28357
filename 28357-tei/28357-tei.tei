    <p>
      Mr. George A. Henty, who died in November, 1902, had
      completed three new stories, <hi rend='italic'>With the Allies to Pekin</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Through
        Three Campaigns</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>By Conduct and Courage</hi>. Of these,
      <hi rend='italic'>Through Three Campaigns</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>With the Allies to Pekin</hi> were
      published in the autumn of 1903; the present story is therefore
      the last of Mr. Henty’s great series of historical stories
      for boys.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The proofs have been revised by Mr. G. A. Henty’s son,
      Captain C. G. Henty.

<head>CHAPTER I</head>

<head type="sub">AN ORPHAN</head>

<p>
A wandering musician was a rarity in the village of
Scarcombe. In fact, such a thing had not been known
in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. What could
have brought him here? men and women asked themselves.
There was surely nobody who could dance in the village, and
the few coppers he would gain by performing on his violin
would not repay him for his trouble. Moreover, Scarcombe
was a bleak place, and the man looked sorely shaken with
the storm of life. He seemed, indeed, almost unable to hold
out much longer; his breath was short, and he had a hacking
cough.
</p>

<p>
To the surprise of the people, he did not attempt to play
for their amusement or to ask, in any way, for alms. He had
taken a lodging in the cottage of one of the fishermen, and on
fine days he would wander out with his boy, a child some five
years old, and, lying down on the moorland, would play soft
tunes to himself. So he lived for three weeks; and then the
end came suddenly. The child ran out one morning from his
room crying and saying that daddy was asleep and he could
<pb n='12'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>not wake him, and on the fisherman going in he saw that
life had been extinct for some hours. Probably it had come
suddenly to the musician himself, for there was found among
his scanty effects no note or memorandum giving a clue to the
residence of the child’s friends, or leaving any direction concerning
him. The clergyman was, of course, called in to advise
as to what should be done. He was a kind-hearted man, and
volunteered to bury the dead musician without charging any fees.
</p>

<p>
After the funeral another question arose. What was to be
done with the child?
</p>

<p>
He was a fine-looking, frank boy, who had grown and
hardened beyond his years by the life he had led with his
father. Fifteen pounds had been found in the dead man’s kit.
This, however, would fall to the share of the workhouse
authorities if they took charge of him. A sort of informal
council was held by the elder fishermen.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is hard on the child,</q> one of them said. <q>I have no
doubt his father intended to tell him where to find his friends,
but his death came too suddenly. Here is fifteen pounds. Not
much good, you will say; and it isn’t. It might last a year,
or maybe eighteen months, but at the end of that time he
would be as badly off as he is now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Maybe John Hammond would take him,</q> another suggested.
<q>He lost his boat and nets three weeks ago, and
though he has a little money saved up, it is not enough to
replace them. Perhaps he would take the child in return for
the fifteen pounds. His old woman could do with him, too,
and would soon make him a bit useful. John himself is a
kind-hearted chap, and would treat him well, and in a few
years the boy would make a useful nipper on board his boat.</q>
</p>

<pb n='13'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>

<p>
John Hammond was sent for, and the case was put to him.
<q>Well,</q> he said, <q>I think I could do with him, and the brass
would be mighty useful to me just now; but how does the law
stand? If it got to be talked about, the parish might come
down upon me for the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, John,</q> one of the others said. <q>The best plan
would be for you, and two of us, to go up to parson, and ask
him how the matter stands. If he says that it is all right,
you may be sure that you would be quite safe.</q>
</p>

<p>
The clergyman, upon being consulted, said that he thought
the arrangement was a very good one. The parish authorities
had not been asked to find any money for the father’s funeral,
and had therefore no say in the matter, unless they were called
upon to take the child. Should any question be asked, he
would state that he himself had gone into the matter and had
strongly approved of the arrangement, which he considered
was to their advantage as well as the child’s; for if they took
charge of the boy they would have to keep him at least ten
years, and then pay for apprenticing him out.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly the boy was handed over to John Hammond.
With the buoyancy of childhood, William Gilmore, which
was the best that could be made of what he gave as his
name, soon felt at home in the fisherman’s cottage. It was
a pleasant change to him after having been a wanderer with
his father for as far back as he could remember. The old
woman was kind in her rough way, and soon took to sending
him on small errands. She set him on washing-days to watch
the pot and tell her when it boiled. When not so employed
she allowed him to play with other children of his own age.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when the weather was fine, John, who had come
<pb n='14'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>to be very fond of the boy, never having had any children of
his own, would take him out with him fishing, to the child’s
supreme enjoyment. After a year of this life he was put to
the village school, which was much less to his liking. Here,
fortunately for himself, he attracted the notice of the clergyman’s
daughter, a girl of sixteen. She, of course, knew his
story, and was filled with a great pity for him. She was a
little inclined to romance, and in her own mind invented many
theories to account for his appearance in the village. Her
father would laugh sometimes when she related some of these
to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear child,</q> he said, <q>it is not necessary to go so far
to account for the history of this poor wandering musician.
You say that he looked to you like a broken-down gentleman;
there are thousands of such men in the country, ne’er-do-wells,
who have tired out all their friends, and have taken at last to
a life that permits a certain amount of freedom and furnishes
them with a living sufficient for necessary wants. It is from
such men as these that the great body of tramps is largely
recruited. Many such men drive hackney-coaches in our large
towns; some of them enlist in the army; but wherever they
are, and whatever they take up, they are sure to stay near the
foot of the tree. They have no inclination for better things.
They work as hard as men who have steady employment, but
they prefer their own liberty with a crust to a solid meal
regularly earned. I agree with you myself that there was an
appearance of having seen better times about this man; I can
go so far with you as to admit that I think that at some time
or other he moved in decent circles; but if we could get at the
truth I have no doubt whatever that we should find that he
<pb n='15'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>had thrown away every opportunity, alienated every friend,
and, having cut himself adrift from all ties, took to the life of
a wanderer. For such a man nothing could be done; but I
hope that the boy, beginning in vastly poorer circumstances
than his father, will some day come to earn his living honestly
in the position of life in which he is placed.</q>
</p>

<p>
The interest, however, which Miss Warden took in the boy
remained unabated, and had a very useful effect upon him.
She persuaded him to come up every day for half an hour to
the rectory, and then instructed him in his lessons, educating
him in a manner very different from the perfunctory teaching
of the old dame at the school. She would urge him on by
telling him that if he would attend to his lessons he would
some day be able to rise to a better position than that of a
village fisherman. His father, no doubt, had had a good
education, but from circumstances over which he had had no
control he had been obliged to take to the life of a strolling
musician, and she was sure that he would have wished of all
things that his son should be able to obtain a good position
in life when he grew up.
</p>

<p>
Under Miss Warden’s teaching the boy made very rapid
progress, and was, before two more years had passed, vastly in
advance of the rest of the children of the village. As to this,
however, by Miss Warden’s advice, he remained silent. When
he was ten his regular schooling was a great deal interrupted,
as it was considered that when a boy reached that age it was
high time that he began to assist his father in the boat. He
was glad of his freedom and the sense that he was able to
make himself useful, but of an evening when he was at home,
or weather prevented the boat from going out, he went up for
<pb n='16'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>his lesson to Miss Warden, and, stealing away from the others,
would lie down on the moor and work at his books.
</p>

<p>
He was now admitted to the society of watchers. He had
often heard whispers among other boys of the look-out that
had to be kept upon the custom-house officers, and heard
thrilling tales of adventure and escape on the part of the fishermen.
Smuggling was indeed carried on on a large scale on the
whole Yorkshire coast, and cargoes were sometimes run under
the very noses of the revenue officers, who were put off the
scent by many ingenious contrivances. Before a vessel was
expected in, rumours would be circulated of an intention to
land the cargo on some distant spot, and a mysterious light
would be shown in that direction by fishing-boats. Sometimes,
however, the smugglers were caught in the act, and
then there would be a fierce fight, ending in some, at least, of
those engaged being taken off to prison and afterwards sent on
a voyage in a ship of war.
</p>

<p>
Will Gilmore was now admitted as a helper in these proceedings,
and often at night would watch one or other of the
revenue men, and if he saw him stir beyond his usual beat
would quickly carry the news to the village. A score of boys
were thus employed, so that any movement which seemed to
evidence a concentration of the coast-guard men was almost
certain to be thwarted. Either the expected vessel was
warned off with lights, or, if the concentration left unguarded
the place fixed upon for landing, the cargo would be immediately
run.
</p>

<p>
Thus another five years passed. Will was now a strong lad.
His friend, Miss Warden, could teach him but little more, but
she often had him up of an evening to have a chat with him.
</p>

<pb n='17'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>

<p>
<q>I am afraid, William,</q> she said one evening, <q>that a
good deal of smuggling is carried on here. Last week there
was a fight, and three of the men of the village were killed
and several were taken away to prison. It is a terrible state
of affairs.</q>
</p>

<p>
William did not for a moment answer. It was something
entirely new to him that there was anything wrong in smuggling.
He regarded it as a mere contest of wits between the
coast-guard and the fishermen, and had taken a keen pleasure
in outwitting the former.
</p>

<p>
<q>But there is no harm in smuggling, Miss Warden. Almost
everyone takes part in it, and the farmers round all send their
carts in when a run is expected.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it is very wrong, William, and the fact that so
many people are ready to aid in it is no evidence in its
favour. People band together to cheat the King’s Revenue,
and thereby bring additional taxation upon those who deal
fairly. It is as much robbery to avoid the excise duties as
it is to carry off property from a house, and it has been a
great grief to my father that his parishioners, otherwise
honest and God-fearing people, should take part in such
doings, as is evidenced by the fact that so many of them were
involved in the fray last week. He only abstains from denouncing
it in the pulpit because he fears that he might
thereby lose the affection of the people and impair his power
of doing good in other respects.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never thought of it in that way, miss,</q> the lad said
seriously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just think in your own case, William: suppose you were
caught and sent off to sea; there would be an end of the
<pb n='18'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>work you have been doing. You would be mixed up with
rough sailors, and, after being away on a long voyage, you
would forget all that you have learnt, and would be as rough
as themselves. This would be a poor ending indeed to all the
pains I have taken with you, and all the labour you have
yourself expended in trying to improve yourself. It would
be a great grief to me, I can assure you, and a cruel disappointment,
to know that my hopes for you had all come to
naught.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They sha’n’t, Miss Warden,</q> the boy said firmly. <q>I
know it will be hard for me to draw back, but, if necessary,
I will leave the village now that you are going to be married.
If you had been going to stay I would have stopped too, but
the village will not be like itself to me after you have left.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to think you mean that. I have remained here
as long as I could be of use to you, for though I have taught
you as much as I could in all branches of education that would
be likely to be useful to you, have lent you my father’s books,
and pushed you forward till I could no longer lead the way,
there are still, of course, many things for you to learn. You
have got a fair start, but you must not be content with that.
If you have to leave, and I don’t think a longer stay here
would be of use to you, I will endeavour to obtain some situation
for you at Scarborough or Whitby, where you could, after
your work is done, continue your education. But I beg you
to do nothing rashly. It would be better if you could stay
here for another year or so. We may hope that the men will
not be so annoyed as you think at your refusal to take further
part in the smuggling operations. At any rate, stay if you
can for a time. It will be two months before I leave, and
<pb n='19'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>three more before I am settled in my new home at Scarborough.
When I am so I have no doubt that my husband
will aid me in obtaining a situation for you. He has been
there for years, and will, of course, have very many friends
and acquaintances who would interest themselves in you. If,
however, you find that your position would be intolerable, you
might remain quiet as to your determination. After the fight
of last week it is not likely that there will be any attempt at
a landing for some little time to come, and I shall not blame
you, therefore, if you at least keep up the semblance of still
taking part in their proceedings.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Miss Warden,</q> the boy said sturdily, <q>I didn’t know
that it was wrong, and therefore joined in it willingly enough,
but now you tell me that it is so I will take no further share
in it, whatever comes of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to hear you say so, William, for it shows that
the aid I have given you has not been thrown away. What
sort of work would you like yourself, if we can get it for
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather go to sea, Miss Warden, than do anything
else. I have, for the last year, taken a lot of pains to understand
those books of navigation you bought for me. I don’t
say that I have mastered them all, but I understand a good
deal, and feel sure that after a few years at sea I shall be able
to pass as a mate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, William, you know that, when I got the books for
you, I told you that I could not help you with them, but I
can quite understand that with your knowledge of mathematics
you would be able at any rate to grasp a great deal of
the subject. I was afraid then that you would take to the
<pb n='20'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>sea. It is a hard life, but one in which a young man capable
of navigating a ship should be able to make his way. Brought
up, as you have been, on the sea, it is not wonderful that you
should choose it as a profession, and, though I may regret it,
I should not think of trying to turn you from it. Very well,
then, I will endeavour to get you apprenticed. It is a hard
life, but not harder than that of a fisherman, to which you
are accustomed.</q>
</p>

<p>
When William returned to his foster-father he informed
him that he did not mean to have anything more to do with
the smuggling.
</p>

<p>
The old man looked at him in astonishment. <q>Are you
mad?</q> he said. <q>Don’t I get five shillings for every night
you are out, generally four or five nights a month, which pays
for all your food.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sorry,</q> the lad said, <q>but I never knew that it was
wrong before, and now I know it I mean to have nothing more
to do with it. What good comes of it? Here we have three
empty cottages, and five or six others from which the heads
will be absent for years. It is dear at any price. I work
hard with you, father, and am never slack; surely the money
I earn in the boat more than pays for my grub.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can guess who told you this,</q> the old man said angrily.
<q>It was that parson’s daughter you are always with.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t say anything against her,</q> the boy said earnestly;
<q>she has been the best friend to me that ever a fellow had,
and as long as I live I shall feel grateful to her. You know
that I am not like the other boys of the village; I can read
and write well, and I have gathered a lot of knowledge from
books. Abuse me as much as you like, but say nothing
<pb n='21'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>against her. You know that the terms on which you took
me expired a year ago, but I have gone on just as before
and am ready to do the same for a time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have been a good lad,</q> the old man said, mollified,
<q>and I don’t know what I should have done without you.
I am nigh past work now, but in the ten years you have
been with me things have always gone well with me, and I
have money enough to make a shift with for the rest of my
life, even if I work no longer. But I don’t like this freak
that you have taken into your head. It will mean trouble, lad,
as sure as you are standing there. The men here won’t understand
you, and will like enough think that the revenue people
have got hold of you. You will be shown the cold shoulder,
and even worse than that may befall you. We fisher-folk are
rough and ready in our ways, and if there is one thing we
hate more than another it is a spy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no intention of being a spy,</q> the boy said. <q>I
have spoken to none of the revenue men, and don’t mean to
do so, and I would not peach even if I were certain that a
cargo was going to be landed. Surely it is possible to stand
aside from it all without being suspected of having gone over
to the enemy. No gold that they could give me would tempt
me to say a word that would lead to the failure of a landing,
and surely there can be no great offence in declining to act
longer as a watcher.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>A wilful man must have his way,</q> he said; <q>but I know
our fellows better than you do, and I foresee that serious
trouble is likely to come of this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if it must be, it must,</q> the boy said doggedly. <q>I
<pb n='22'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>mean, if I live, to be a good man, and now that I know that
it is wrong to cheat the revenue I will have no more to do
with it. It would be a nice reward for all the pains Miss
Warden has spent upon me to turn round and do what she
tells me is wrong.</q>
</p>

<p>
John Hammond was getting to the age when few things
excite more than a feeble surprise. He felt that the loss of
the boy’s assistance would be a heavy one, for he had done no
small share of the work for the past two years. But he had
more than once lately talked to his wife of the necessity for
selling his boat and nets and remaining at home. With this
decision she quite agreed, feeling that he was indeed becoming
incapable of doing the work, and every time he had gone out
in anything but the calmest weather she had been filled with
apprehension as to what would happen if a storm were to blow
up. He was really sorry for the boy, being convinced that
harm would befall him as the result of this, to him, astonishing
decision. To John Hammond smuggling appeared to be
quite justifiable. The village had always been noted as a nest
of smugglers, and to him it came as natural as fishing. It was
a pity, a grievous pity, that the boy should have taken so
strange a fancy.
</p>

<p>
He was a good boy, a hard-working boy, and the only fault
he had to find with him was his unaccountable liking for
study. John could neither read nor write, and for the life
of him could not see what good came of it. He had always
got on well without it, and when the school was first started
he and many others shook their heads gravely over it, and
regarded it as a fad of the parson’s. Still, as it only affected
children too young to be useful in the boats, they offered no
<pb n='23'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>active opposition, and in time the school had come to be
regarded as chiefly a place where the youngsters were kept
out of their mothers’ way when washing and cooking were
going on.
</p>

<p>
He went slowly back into the cottage and acquainted his
wife with this new and astonishing development on the part
of the boy. His wife was full of indignation, which was,
however, modified at the thought that she would now have
her husband always at home with her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall speak my mind to Miss Warden,</q> she said, <q>and
tell her how much harm her advice has done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, Jenny,</q> her husband said; <q>what is the use of
that? It is the parson’s duty to be meddling in all sorts of
matters, and it will do no good to fight against it. Parson
is a good man, all allow, and he always finishes his sermons
in time for us to get home to dinner. I agree with you that
the young madam has done harm, and I greatly fear that
trouble will come to the boy. There are places where smuggling
is thought to be wrong, but this place ain’t among them.
I don’t know what will happen when Will says that he doesn’t
mean to go any more as a watcher, but there is sure to be
trouble of some sort.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was not long indeed before Will felt a change in the
village. Previous to this he had been generally popular, now
men passed without seeing him. He was glad when John
Hammond called upon him to go out in the boat, when the
weather was fine, but at other times his only recourse was to
steal away to the moors with his books. Presently the elder
boys took to throwing sods at him as he passed, and calling
spy and other opprobrious epithets after him. This brought
<pb n='24'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>on several severe fights, and as Will made up for want of
weight by pluck and activity his opponents more than once
found themselves badly beaten. One day he learned from a
subdued excitement in the village that it was time for one
of the smuggling vessels to arrive. One of his boyish friends
had stuck to him, and was himself almost under a ban for
associating with so unpopular a character.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t you come with me, Stevens,</q> Will had urged again
and again; <q>you will only make it bad for yourself, and it
will do me no good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t care,</q> the former said sturdily. <q>We have always
been good friends, and you know I don’t in the least believe
that you have anything to do with the revenue men. It is
too bad of them to say so. I fought Tom Dickson only this
morning for abusing you. He said if you were not working
with them, why did you give up being on the watch. I told
him it was no odds to me why you gave it up, I supposed
that you had a right to do as you liked. Then from words
we came to blows. I don’t say I beat him, for he is a good
bit bigger than I am, but I gave him as good as I got, and he
was as glad to stop as I was. You talk of going away soon.
If you do, and you will take me, I will go with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know yet where I am going, Tommy, but if I go
to a town I have no doubt I shall be able in a short time
to hear of someone there who wants a strong lad, or perhaps
I may be able to get you a berth as cabin-boy in the ship
in which I go. I mean to go for a sailor myself if I can, and
I shall be glad to have you as a chum on board. We have
always been great friends, and I am sure we always shall be,
Tommy. If I were you I would think it over a good many
<pb n='25'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>times before you decide upon it. You see I have learnt a
great deal from books to prepare myself for a sea life. Miss
Warden is going to try to get me taken as an apprentice, and
in that case I may hope to get to be an officer when my time
is out, but you would not have much chance of doing so. Of
course if we were together I could help you on. So far you
have never cared for books or to improve yourself, and without
that you can never rise to be any more than a common
sailor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hate books,</q> the boy said; <q>still, I will try what I can
do. But at any rate I don’t care much so that I am with
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we will see about it when the time comes, Tommy.
Miss Warden was married, as you know, last week. In
another three months she will be at Scarborough, and she has
promised that her husband will try to get me apprenticed
either there or at Whitby, which is a large port. Directly I
get on board a ship I will let you know if there is a vacancy
in her for a cabin-boy. But you think it over well first; you
will find it difficult, for I don’t expect your uncle will let
you go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t care a snap about him. He is always knocking me
about, and I don’t care what he likes and what he don’t. You
may be sure that I sha’n’t ask him, but shall make off at night
as soon as I hear from you. You won’t forget me, will you,
Will?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I will not; you may be quite sure of that. Mind,
I don’t promise that I shall be able to get you a berth as
cabin-boy at once, or as an apprentice. I only promise that
I will do so as soon as I have a chance. It may be a month,
<pb n='26'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>and it may be a year; it may even be three or four years, for
though there is always a demand for men, at least so I have
heard, there may not be any demand for boys. But you may
be sure that I will not keep you waiting any longer than I can
help.</q>
</p>

<p>
One day Will was walking along the cliffs, feeling very
solitary, when he heard a faint cry, and, looking down, saw
Tom Stevens in a deep pool. It had precipitous sides, and
he was evidently unable to climb out. <q>Hold on, Tom,</q> he
shouted, <q>I will come to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was half a mile before he could get to a place where he was
able to climb down, and when he reached the shore he ran
with breathless speed to the spot where Tom’s head was still
above the water. He saw at once that his friend’s strength
was well-nigh spent, and, leaping in, he swam to him. <q>Put
your arms round my neck,</q> he said. <q>I will swim down
with you to the point where the creek ends.</q> The boy was
too far gone to speak, and it needed all Will’s strength to
help him down the deep pool to the point where it joined the
sea, and then to haul him ashore.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was nearly gone, Will,</q> the boy said when he recovered
a little.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I saw that. But how on earth did you manage to
get into the water?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was running along by the side of the cliff, when my foot
slipped. I came down on my knee and hurt myself frightfully;
I was in such pain that I could not stop myself from
rolling over. I tried to swim, which, of course, would have
been nothing for me, but I think my knee is smashed, and it
hurt me so frightfully that I screamed out with pain, and had
<pb n='27'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>to give up. I could not have held on much longer, and should
certainly have been drowned had you not seen me. I was
never so pleased as when I heard your voice above.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you walk now, do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I am sure I can’t walk by myself, but I might if I
leant on you. I will try anyhow.</q>
</p>

<p>
He hobbled along for a short distance, but at last said: <q>It
is of no use, Will, I can’t go any farther.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, get on my back and I will see what I can do for
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Slowly and with many stoppages Will got him to the point
where he descended the cliff. <q>I must get help to carry you
up here, Tom; it is very steep, and I am sure I could not take
you myself. I must go into the village and bring assistance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will wait here till morning, Will. There will be no
hardship in that, and I know that you don’t like speaking to
anyone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will manage it,</q> Will said cheerfully. <q>I will tell John
Hammond, and he will go to your uncle and get help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that will do! Most of the men are out, but I dare
say there will be two or three at home.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will ran all the way back to the village, which was more
than a mile away. <q>Tom Stevens is lying at the foot of the
cliff, father. I think he has broken his leg, and he has been
nearly drowned. Will you go and see his uncle, and get three
or four men to carry him home. You know very well it is no
use my going to his uncle. He would not listen to what I have
to say, and would simply shower abuse upon me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go,</q> the old man said. <q>The boy can’t be left
there.</q>
</p>

<pb n='28'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>

<p>
In a quarter of an hour the men started. Will went
ahead of them for some distance until he reached the top of
the path. <q>He is down at the bottom,</q> he said, and turned
away. Tom was brought home, and roundly abused by his
uncle for injuring himself so that he would be unable to
accompany him in his boat for some days. He lay for a week
in bed, and was then only able to hobble about with the aid of
a stick. When he related how Will had saved him there was a
slight revulsion of feeling among the better-disposed boys, but
this was of short duration. It became known that a French
lugger would soon be on the coast. Will was not allowed to
approach the edge of the cliff, being assailed by curses and
threats if he ventured to do so. Every care was taken to
throw the coast-guard off the scent, but things went badly.
There was some sharp fighting, and a considerable portion of
the cargo was seized as it was being carried up the cliff.
</p>

<p>
The next day Tom hurried up to Will, who was a short
way out on the moor.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must run for your life, Will. There are four or five
of the men who say that you betrayed them last night, and I
do believe they will throw you over the cliff. Here they
come! The best thing you can do is to make for the coast-guard
station.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will saw that the four men who were coming along were
among the roughest in the village, and started off immediately
at full speed. With oaths and shouts the men pursued him.
The coast-guard station was two miles away, and he reached
it fifty yards in front of them. The men stopped, shouting:
<q>You are safe there, but as soon as you leave it we will have
you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='29'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>

<p>
<q>What is the matter, lad?</q> the sub-officer in charge of the
station said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Those men say that I betrayed them, but you know ’tis
false, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I do. I know you well by sight, and believe
that you are a good young fellow. I have always heard you
well spoken of. What makes them think that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is because I would not agree to go on acting as watcher.
I did not know that there was any harm in it till Miss Warden
told me, and then I would not do it any longer, and that set
all the village against me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you going to do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will stay here to-night if you will let me. I am sure
they will keep up a watch for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will sling a hammock for you,</q> the man said. <q>Now we
are just going to have dinner, and I dare say you can eat
something. You are the boy they call Miss Warden’s pet,
are you not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, they call me so. She has been very kind to me, and
has helped me on with my books.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, well, a boy is sure to get disliked by his fellows when
he is cleverer with his books than they are!</q>
</p>

<p>
After dinner the officer said: <q>It is quite clear that you
won’t be able to return to the village. I think I have heard
that you have no father. Is it not so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he died when I was five years old. He left a little
money, and John Hammond took me in and bought a boat
with that and what he had saved. I was bound to stay with
him until I was fourteen years old, but was soon going to
leave him, for he is really too old to go out any longer.</q>
</p>

<pb n='30'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>

<p>
<q>Have you ever thought of going into the royal navy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have thought of it, sir, but I have not settled anything.
I thought of going into the merchant navy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bah! I am surprised at a lad of spirit like you thinking
of such a thing. If you have learned a lot you will, if you
are steady, be sure to get on in time, and may very well
become a petty officer. No lad of spirit would take to the
life of a merchantman who could enter the navy. I don’t say
that some of the Indiamen are not fine ships, but you would
find it very hard to get a berth on one of them. Our lieutenant
will be over here in a day or two, and I have no doubt
that if I speak to him for you he will ship you as a boy in a
fine ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How long does one ship for, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You engage for the time that the ship is in commission, at
the outside for five years; and if you find that you do not like
it, at the end of that time it is open to you to choose some
other berth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can enter the merchant navy then if I like?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course you could, but I don’t think that you would.
On a merchantman you would be kicked and cuffed all round,
whereas on a man-of-war I don’t say it would be all easy sailing,
but if you were sharp and obliging things would go
smoothly enough for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I will think it over to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good, my boy! you are quite right not to decide in a hurry.
It is a serious thing for a young chap to make a choice like
that; but it seems to me that, being without friends as you are,
and having made enemies of all the people of your village, it
would be better for you to get out of it as soon as possible.</q>
</p>

<pb n='31'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>

<p>
<q>I quite see that; and really I think I could not do better
than pass a few years on a man-of-war, for after that I should
be fit for any work I might find to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sleep upon it, lad.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will sat down on the low wall in front of the station and
thought it over. After all, it seemed to him that it would be
better to be on a fine ship and have a chance of fighting with
the French than to sail in a merchantman. At the end of
five years he would be twenty, and could pass as a mate if
he chose, or settle on land. He would have liked to consult
Miss Warden, but this was out of the question. He knew
the men who had pursued him well enough to be sure that
his life would not be safe if they caught him. He might
make his way out of the station at night, but even that was
doubtful. Besides, if he were to do so he had no one to go
to at Scarborough; he had not a penny in his pocket, and
would find it impossible to maintain himself until Miss
Warden returned. He did not wish to appear before her as
a beggar. He was still thinking when a shadow fell across
him, and, looking up, he saw his friend Tom.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have come round to see you, Will,</q> he said. <q>I don’t
know what is to be done. Nothing will convince the village
that you did not betray them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The thing is too absurd,</q> Will said angrily. <q>I never
spoke to a coast-guardsman in my life till to-day, except,
perhaps, in passing, and then I would do no more than make
a remark about the weather. Besides, no one in the village
has spoken to me for a month, so how could I tell that the
lugger was coming in that night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I really don’t think it would be safe for you to go back.</q>
</p>

<pb n='32'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>

<p>
<q>I am not going back. I have not quite settled what I
shall do, but certainly I don’t intend to return to the village.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then what are you going to do, Will?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know exactly, but I have half decided to ship as
a boy on one of the king’s ships.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like to go with you wherever you go, but I
should like more than anything to do that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a serious business, you know; you would have to
make up your mind to be kicked and cuffed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I get that at home,</q> Tom said; <q>it can’t be harder for me
at sea than it is there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I have not got to decide until to-morrow; you go
home and think it over, and if you come in the morning with
your mind made up, I will speak to the officer here and ask
him if they will take us both.</q>

<head>CHAPTER II</head>

<head type="sub">IN THE KING’S SERVICE</head>

<p>
Before morning came Will had thought the matter over
in every light, and concluded that he could not do better
than join the navy for a few years. Putting all other things
aside, it was a life of adventure, and adventure is always
tempting to boys. It really did not seem to him that, if he
entered the merchant service at once, he would be any better
off than he would be if he had a preliminary training in the
royal navy. He knew that the man-of-war training would
make him a smarter sailor, and he hoped that he would find
<pb n='33'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>time enough on board ship to continue his work, so that
afterwards he might be able to pass as a mate in the merchant
service.
</p>

  <p>
Tom Stevens came round in the morning.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have quite made up my mind to go with you if you will
let me,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will let you readily enough, Tom, but I must warn you
that you will not have such a good look-out as I shall. You
know, I have learnt a good deal, and if the first cruise lasts
for five years I have no doubt that at the end of it I shall be
able to pass as a mate in the merchant service, and I am
afraid you will have very little chance of doing so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can’t help that,</q> Tom said. <q>I know that I am not like
you, and I haven’t learnt things, and I don’t suppose that if I
had had anyone to help me it would have made any difference.
I know I shall never rise much above a sailor before the mast.
If you leave the service and go into a merchantman I will go
there with you. It does not matter to me where I am. I felt
so before, and of course I feel it all the more now that you
have saved my life. I am quite sure you will get on in the
world, Will, and sha’n’t grudge you your success a bit, however
high you rise, for I know how hard you have worked, and
how well you deserve it. Besides, even if I had had the pains
bestowed upon me, and had worked ever so hard myself,
I should never have been a bit like you. You seem different
from us somehow. I don’t know how it is, but you are
smarter and quicker and more active. I expect some day
you will find out something about your father, and then
probably we shall be able to understand the difference between
us. At any rate I am quite prepared to see you rise,
<pb n='34'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>and I shall be well content if you will always allow me to
remain your friend.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will gratified the sub-officer later by telling him that he
had made up his mind to ship on board one of the king’s
vessels, and that his friend and chum, Tom Stevens, had
made up his mind to go with him.
</p>

<p>
The coxswain looked Tom up and down.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have the makings of a fine strong man,</q> he said,
<q>and ought to turn out a good sailor. The training you have
had in the fishing-boats will be all in your favour. Well, I
will let you know when the lieutenant makes his rounds. I
am sure there will be no difficulty in shipping you. Boys ain’t
what they were when I was young. Then we thought it an
honour to be shipped on board a man-of-war, now most of
them seem to me mollycoddled, and we have difficulty in
getting enough boys for the ships. You see, we are not
allowed to press boys, but only able-bodied men; so the
youngsters can laugh in our faces. Most of the crimps get
one or two of them to watch the sailors as the boys of the
village watch our men, and give notice when they are going to
make a raid. I don’t think, therefore, that there is any fear of
your being refused, especially when I say that one of you has
got into great trouble from refusing to aid in throwing us off
the scent when a lugger is due. If for no other reason he
owes you a debt for that.</q>
</p>

<p>
Three days passed. Will still remained at the coast-guard
station, and men still hovered near. Tom came over once
and said that it had been decided among a number of the
fishermen that no great harm should be done to Will when
they got him, but that he should be thrashed within an
<pb n='35'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>inch of his life. On the third day the coxswain said to
Will:
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a message this morning from the lieutenant, that
he will be here by eleven o’clock. If you will write a line to
your friend I will send it over by one of the men.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tom arrived breathless two minutes before the officer.
</p>

<p>
<q>My eye, I have had a run of it,</q> he said. <q>The man
brought me the letter just as I was going to start in the boat
with my uncle. I pretended to have left something behind me
and ran back to the cottage, he swearing after me all the way
for my stupidity. I ran into the house, and then got out of the
window behind, and started for the moors, taking good care
to keep the house in a line between him and me. My, what
a mad rage he will be in when I don’t come back, and he goes
up and finds that I have disappeared! I stopped a minute to
take a clean shirt and my Sunday clothes. I expect, when he
sees I am not in the cottage, he will look round, and he will
discover that they have gone from their pegs, and guess that
I have made a bolt of it. He won’t guess, however, that I
have come here, but will think I have gone across the moors.
He knows very well how hard he has made my life; still, that
won’t console him for losing me, just as I am getting really
useful in the boat.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant landed from his cutter at the foot of the path
leading up to the station. The sub-officer received him at
the top, and after a few words they walked up to the station
together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who are these two boys?</q> he asked as he came up to them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two lads who wish to enter the navy, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Umph! runaways, I suppose?</q>
</p>

<pb n='36'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>

<p>
<q>Not exactly, sir. Both of them are fatherless. That one
has received a fair education from the daughter of the clergyman
of the village, who took a great fancy to him. He has
for some years now been assisting in one of the fishing-boats
and, as he acknowledges, in the spying upon our men, as
practically everyone else in the village does. When, however,
Miss Warden told him that smuggling was very wrong,
he openly announced his intention of having nothing more to
do with it. This has had the effect of making the ignorant
villagers think that he must have taken bribes from us to
keep us informed of what was going on. In consequence he
has suffered severe persecution and has been sent to Coventry.
After the fight we had with them the other day they appear
to think that there could be no further doubt of his being
concerned in the matter, and four men set out after him to
take his life. He fled here as his nearest possible refuge, and
if you will look over there you will see two men on the watch
for him. He had made up his mind to ship as an apprentice
on a merchantman, but I have talked the matter over with
him, and he has now decided to join a man-of-war.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A very good choice,</q> the officer said. <q>I suppose you
can read and write, lad?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir,</q> Will said, suppressing a smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Know a bit more, perhaps?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you are civil and well behaved, you will get on.
And who is the other one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is Gilmore’s special chum, sir. He has a brute of an
uncle who is always knocking him about, and he wants to go
to sea with his friend.</q>
</p>

<pb n='37'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>

<p>
<q>Well, they are two likely youngsters. The second is more
heavily built than the other, but there is no doubt as to which
is the more intelligent. I will test them at once, and then
take them off with me in the cutter and hand them over to
the tender at Whitby. Now send four men and catch those
two fellows and bring them in here. I will give them a sharp
lesson against ill-treating a lad who refuses to join them in
their rascally work.</q>
</p>

<p>
A minute later four of the men strolled off by the cliffs,
two in each direction. When they had got out of sight of the
watchers, they struck inland, and, making a detour, came down
behind them. The fishermen did not take the alarm until it
was too late. They started to run, but the sailors were
more active and quick-footed, and, presently capturing them,
brought them back to the coast-guard station.
</p>

<p>
<q>So my men,</q> the lieutenant said sternly, <q>you have been
threatening to ill-treat one of His Majesty’s subjects for refusing
to join you in your attempts to cheat the revenue? I might
send you off to a magistrate for trial, in which case you would
certainly get three months’ imprisonment. I prefer, however,
settling such matters myself. Strip them to the waist, lads.</q>
</p>

<p>
The orders were executed in spite of the men’s struggles
and execrations.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now tie them up to the flag-post and give them a dozen
heartily.</q>
</p>

<p>
As the men were all indignant at the treatment that had
been given to Will they laid the lash on heavily, and the
execrations that followed the first few blows speedily subsided
into shrieks for mercy, followed at last by low moaning.
</p>

<p>
When both had received their punishment, the lieutenant
<pb n='38'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>said: <q>Now you can put on your clothes again and carry the
news of what you have had to your village, and tell your
friends that I wish I had had every man concerned in the
matter before me. If I had I would have dealt out the same
punishment to all. Now, lads, I shall be leaving in an hour’s
time; if you like to send back to the village for your clothes,
one of the men will take the message.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tom already had all his scanty belongings, but Will was
glad to send a note to John Hammond, briefly stating his
reasons for leaving, and thanking him for his kindness in the
past, and asking him to send his clothes to him by the bearer.
An hour and a half later they embarked in the lieutenant’s
gig and were rowed off to the revenue cutter lying a quarter
of a mile away. Here they were put under the charge of the
boatswain.
</p>

<p>
<q>They have shipped for the service, Thompson,</q> the lieutenant
said. <q>I think they are good lads. Make them as
comfortable as you can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you have shipped, have you?</q> the boatswain said as he
led them forward. <q>Well, you are plucky young cockerels.
It ain’t exactly a bed of roses, you will find, at first, but if you
can always keep your temper and return a civil answer to a
question you will soon get on all right. You will have more
trouble with the other boys than with the men, and will have
a battle or two to fight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We sha’n’t mind that,</q> Will said; <q>we have had to deal
with some tough ones already in our own village, and have
proved that we are better than most of our own age. At any
rate we won’t be licked easily, even if they are a bit bigger
and stronger than ourselves, and after all a licking doesn’t go
<pb n='39'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>for much anyway. What ship do you think they will send us
to, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that is a good deal more than I can say! There is a
cutter that acts as a receiving-ship at Whitby, and you will
be sent off from it as opportunity offers and the ships of war
want hands. Like enough you will go off with a batch down
to the south in a fortnight or so, and will be put on board
some ship being commissioned at Portsmouth or Devonport.
A large cutter comes round the coast once a month, to pick
up the hands from the various receiving-ships, and as often
as not she goes back with a hundred. And a rum lot you
will think them. There are jail-birds who have had the offer
of release on condition that they enter the navy; there are
farm-labourers who don’t know one end of a boat from the
other; there are drunkards who have been sold by the crimps
when their money has run out; but, Lord bless you, it don’t
make much difference what they are, they are all knocked into
shape before they have been three months on board. I think,
however, you will have a better time than this. Our lieutenant
is a kind-hearted man, though he is strict enough in the way
of business, and I have no doubt he will say a good word for
you to the commander of the tender, which, as he is the senior
officer, will go a long way.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two boys were soon on good terms with the crew, who
divined at once that they were lads of mettle, and were
specially attracted to Will on account of the persecution he
had suffered by refusing to act as the smugglers’ watcher, and
also when they heard from Tom how he had saved his life.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will do,</q> was the verdict of an old sailor. <q>I can see
that you have both got the right stuff in you. When one
<pb n='40'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>fellow saves another’s life, and that fellow runs away and ships
in order to be near his friend, you may be sure that there is
plenty of good stuff in them, and that they will turn out a
credit to His Majesty’s service.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were a week on board before the cutter finished her
trip at Whitby. Both boys had done their best to acquire
knowledge, and had learnt the names of the ropes and their
uses by the time they got to port.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need not go on board the depot ship until to-morrow,</q>
the lieutenant said. <q>I will go across with you myself. I have
had my eye upon you ever since you came on board, and I
have seen that you have been trying hard to learn, and have
always been ready to give a pull on a rope when necessary.
I have no fear of your getting on. It is a pity we don’t get
more lads of your type in the navy.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the following morning the lieutenant took them on board
the depot and put them under the charge of the boatswain.
<q>You will have to mix with a roughish crew here,</q> the latter
said, <q>but everything will go smoothly enough when you
once join your ship. You had better hand over your kits
to me to keep for you, otherwise there won’t be much left at
the end of the first night; and if you like I will let you stow
yourselves away at night in the bitts forward. It is not cold,
and I will throw a bit of old sail-cloth over you; you will be
better there than down with the others, where the air is almost
thick enough to cut.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much, sir; we should prefer that. We
have both been accustomed to sleep at night in the bottom of
an open boat, so it will come natural enough to us. Are there
any more boys on board?</q>
</p>

<pb n='41'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>

<p>
<q>No, you are the only ones. We get more boys down in
the west, but up here very few ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went below together. <q>Dimchurch,</q> the boatswain
said to a tall sailor-like man, <q>these boys have just joined. I
wish you would keep an eye on them, and prevent anyone
from bullying them. I know that you are a pressed man, and
that we have no right to expect anything of you until you
have joined your ship, but I can see that for all that you are
a true British sailor, and I trust to you to look after these
boys.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, mate!</q> the sailor said. <q>I will take the nippers
under my charge, and see that no one meddles with them. I
know what I had to go through when I first went to sea, and
am glad enough to do a good turn to any youngsters joining.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you! Then I will leave them now in your charge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is your first voyage, I suppose,</q> the sailor said as he
sat down on the table and looked at the boys. <q>I see by
your togs that you have been fishing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we both had seven or eight years of it, though of
course we were of no real use till the last five.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don’t speak like a fisherman’s boy either,</q> the man
said.
</p>

<p>
<q>No. A lady interested herself in me and got me to work
all my spare time at books.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, they will be of no use to you at present, but they
may come in handy some day to get you a rating. I never
learnt to read or write myself or I should have been mate
long ago. This is my first voyage in a ship of war. Hitherto
I have always escaped being pressed when I was ashore, but
now they have caught me I don’t mind having a try at it.
<pb n='42'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>I believe, from all I hear, that the grub and treatment are
better than aboard most merchantmen, and the work nothing
like so hard. Of course the great drawback is the cat, but I
expect that a well-behaved man doesn’t often feel it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The others had looked on curiously when the lads first came
down, but they soon turned away indifferently and took up
their former pursuits. Some were playing cards, others
lying about half-asleep. Two or three who were fortunate
enough to be possessed of tobacco were smoking. In all there
were some forty men. When the evening meal was served
out the sailor placed one of the boys on each side of him, and
saw that they got their share.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must find a place for you to sleep,</q> he said when they
had finished.
</p>

<p>
<q>The officer who brought us down has given us permission
to sleep on deck near the bitts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes, that is quite in the bows of the ship! You will
do very well there, much better than you would down here.
I will go up on deck and show you the place. How is it that
he is looking specially after you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe Lieutenant Jones of the <name type="ship">Antelope</name> was good enough
to speak to the officer in command of this craft in our favour.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How did you make him your friend?</q>
</p>

<p>
Will told briefly the story of his troubles with the
smugglers. The sailor laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> he said, <q>you must be a pretty plucky one to fly in
the face of a smuggling village in that way. You must have
known what the consequence would be, and it is not every
boy, nor every man either, if it comes to that, that would
venture to do as you did.</q>
</p>

<pb n='43'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>

<p>
<q>It did not seem to me that I had any choice when I once
found out that it was wrong.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailor laughed again. <q>Well, you know, it is not what
you could call a crime, though it is against the law of the
land, but everyone does a bit of smuggling when they get the
chance. Lord bless you! I have come home from abroad when
there was not one of the passengers and crew who did not
have a bit of something hidden about him or his luggage—brandy,
’baccy, French wines, or knick-knacks of some sort.
Pretty nigh half of them got found out and fined, but the
value of the things got ashore was six or eight times as much
as what was collared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Still it was not right,</q> Will persisted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no! it was not right,</q> the sailor said carelessly, <q rend="post: none">but
everyone took his chance. It is a sort of game, you see, between
the passengers and crew on one side and the custom-house
officers on the other. It was enough to make one laugh
to see the passengers land. Women who had been as thin as
whistles came out as stout matrons, owing to the yards and
yards of laces and silk they had wound round them. All
sorts of odd places were choke-full of tobacco; there were
cases that looked like baggage, but really had a tin lining,
which was full of brandy. It was a rare game for those who
got through, I can tell you, though I own it was not so pleasant
for those who got caught and had their contraband goods confiscated,
besides having to pay five times the proper duty. As
a rule the men took it quietly enough, they had played the
game and lost; but as for the women, they were just raging
tigers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For myself, I laughed fit to split. If I lost anything it
<pb n='44'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>was a pound or two of tobacco which I was taking home for
my old father, and I felt that things might have been a deal
worse if they had searched the legs of my trousers, where I
had a couple of bladders filled with good brandy. You see,
young ’un, though everyone knows that it is against the law,
no one thinks it a crime. It is a game you play; if you lose
you pay handsomely, but if you win you get off scot-free. I
think the lady who told you it was wrong did you a very bad
service, for if she lived near that village she must have known
that you would get into no end of trouble if you were to say
you would have nothing more to do with it. And how is it</q>—turning
to Tom—<q>that you came to go with him? You
did not take it into your head that smuggling was wrong too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never thought of it,</q> Tom said, <q>and if I had been told
so should only have answered that what was good enough for
others was good enough for me. I came because Will came.
We had always been great friends, and more than once joined
to thrash a big fellow who put upon us. But the principal thing
was that a little while ago he saved me from drowning. There
was a deep cut running up to the foot of the cliffs. One day
I was running past there, when I slipped, and in falling hurt
my leg badly. I am only just beginning to use it a bit now.
The pain was so great that I did not know what I was doing;
I rolled off the rock into the water. My knee was so bad that
I could not swim, and the rock was too high for me to crawl
out. I had been there for some time, and was beginning to
get weak, when Will came along on the top of the cliff and
saw me. He shouted to me to hold on till he could get down
to me. Then he ran half a mile to a place where he was able
to climb down, and tore back again along the shore till he
<pb n='45'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>reached the cut, and then jumped in and swam to me. There
was no getting out on either side, so he swam with me to the
end of the cut and landed me there. I was by that time
pretty nigh insensible, but he half-helped and half-carried me
till we got to the point of the cliff where he had come down.
Then he left me and ran off to the village to get help. So you
will understand now why I should wish to stick to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think so,</q> the sailor said warmly. <q>It was a fine
thing to do, and I would be glad to do it myself. Stick to
him, lad, as long as he will let you. I fancy, from the way he
speaks and his manner, that he will mount up above you, but
never you mind that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I won’t, as long as I can keep by him, and I hope that
soon I may have a chance of returning him the service he
has done me. He knows well enough that if I could I would
give my life for him willingly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think,</q> the sailor said to Will seriously, <q>you are a
fortunate fellow to have made a friend like that. A good
chum is the next best thing to a good wife. In fact, I don’t
know if it is not a bit better. Ah, here comes the boatswain
with a bit of sail-cloth, so you had better lie down at once. We
shall most of us turn in soon down below, for there is nothing
to pass the time, and I for one shall be very glad when the
cutter comes for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys chatted for some time under cover of the sail-cloth.
They agreed that things were much better than they
could have expected. The protection of the boatswain was
a great thing, but that of their sailor friend was better.
They hoped that he would be told off to the ship in which
they went, for they felt sure that he would be a valuable
<pb n='46'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>friend to them. The life on board the cutter, too, had been
pleasant, and altogether they congratulated themselves on the
course they had taken.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no doubt we shall like it very much when we are
once settled. They look a rough lot down below, and that
sentry standing with a loaded musket at the gangway shows
pretty well what sort of men they are. I am not surprised
that the pressed men should try to get away, but I have no
pity for the drunken fellows who joined when they had spent
their last shilling. Our fishermen go on a spree sometimes,
but not often, and when they do, they quarrel and fight a bit,
but they always go to work the next morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a different thing altogether, for I heard that in
the towns men will spend every penny they have, give up
work altogether, and become idle, lazy loafers.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two days later, to the great satisfaction of the boys, a
large cutter flying the white ensign was seen approaching
the harbour. No doubt was entertained that she was the
receiving-ship. This was confirmed when the officer in charge
of the depot-ship was rowed to the new arrival as soon as the
anchor was dropped. A quarter of an hour later he returned,
and it became known that the new hands were to be taken to
Portsmouth. The next morning two boats rowed alongside.
Will could not but admire the neat and natty appearance of
the crew, which formed a somewhat striking contrast to the
slovenly appearance of the gang on the depot-ship. A list of
the new men was handed over to the officer in charge, and
these were at once transferred to the big cutter.
</p>

<p>
Here everything was exquisitely clean and neat. The new-comers
were at once supplied with uniforms, and told off as
<pb n='47'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>supernumeraries to each watch. Will and Tom received no
special orders, and were informed that they were to make
themselves generally useful. Beyond having to carry an
occasional message from one or other of the midshipmen, or
boatswain, their duties were of the lightest kind. They
helped at the distribution of the messes, the washing of the
decks, the paring of the potatoes for dinner, and other odd
jobs. When not wanted they could do as they pleased, and
Will employed every spare moment in gaining what information
he could from his friend Dimchurch, or from any sailor he
saw disengaged and wearing a look that invited interrogation.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem to want to know a lot all at once, youngster,</q>
one said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have got to learn it sooner or later,</q> Will replied, <q>and
it is just as well to learn as much as I can while I have time
on my hands. I expect I shall get plenty to do when I join
a ship at Portsmouth. May I go up the rigging?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That you may not. You don’t suppose that His Majesty’s
ships are intended to look like trees with rooks perched all
over them? You will be taught all that in due time. There
is plenty to learn on deck, and when you know all that, it
will be time enough to think of going aloft. You don’t want
to become a Blake or a Benbow all at once, do you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> Will laughed, <q>it will be time to think of that in
another twenty years.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailor broke into a roar of laughter.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, there is nothing like flying high, young ’un; but
there is no reason why in time you should not get to be
captain of the fore-top or coxswain of the captain’s gig. I
suppose either of these would content you?</q>
</p>

<pb n='48'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>

<p>
<q>I suppose it ought,</q> Will said with a merry laugh. <q>At
any rate it will be time to think of higher posts when I have
gained one of these.</q>
</p>

<p>
The voyage to Portsmouth was uneventful. They stopped
at several receiving-stations on their way down, and before
they reached their destination they had gathered a hundred
and twenty men. Will and Tom were astonished at the bustle
and activity of the port. Frigates and men-of-war lay off
Portsmouth and out at Spithead; boats of various sizes rowed
between them, or to and from the shore. Never had they
imagined such a scene; the enormous bulk of the men-of-war
struck them with wonder. Will admired equally the tapering
spars and the more graceful lines of the frigates and corvettes,
and his heart thrilled with pride as he felt that he too was a
sailor, and a portion, however insignificant, of one of these
mighty engines of war.
</p>

<p>
The officer in command of the receiving-ship at Whitby had
passed on to the captain of the cutter what had been told him
of the two boys by the lieutenant of the <name type="ship">Antelope</name>, and he in
turn related the story to one of the chief officers of the dockyard.
It happened that they were the only two boys that had
been brought down, and the dockyard official said it would
be a pity to separate them.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will put them down as part of the crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name>.
I want a few specially strong and active men for her; her
commander is a very dashing officer, and I should like to see
that he is well manned.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two boys had especially noticed and admired the
<name type="ship">Furious</name>, which was a thirty-four-gun frigate, so next morning,
when the new hands were mustered and told off to different
<pb n='49'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>ships, they were delighted when they found their names appear
at the end of the list for that vessel, all the more so because
Dimchurch was to join her also.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am pleased, Dimchurch, that we are to be in the same
ship with you,</q> Will exclaimed as soon as the men were dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad too, youngster. I have taken a fancy to you,
as you seem to have done to me, and it will be very pleasant
for us to be together. But now you must go and get your
kit-bags ready at once; we are sure to be sent off to the
<name type="ship">Furious</name> in a short time, and it will be a bad mark against you
if you keep the boat waiting.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a quarter of an hour a boat was seen approaching from
the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. The officer in charge ascended to the deck of
the cutter, and after a chat with the captain called out the
list, and counted the men one by one as they went down to
the boat, each carrying his kit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bad lot,</q> he said to the young midshipman sitting
by his side. <q>This pretty nearly makes up our complement;
the press gang are sure to pick up the few hands we want
either to-day or to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be glad when we are off, sir,</q> the midshipman said.
<q>I am never comfortable, after beginning to get into commission,
until we are out on blue water.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor am I. I hope the dockyard won’t keep us waiting
for stores. We have got most of them, but the getting on
board of the powder and shot is always a long task, and we
have to be so careful with the powder. There is the captain
on deck; he is looking out, no doubt, to see the new hands.
I am glad they are good ones, for nothing puts him into a
<pb n='50'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>bad temper so readily as having a man brought on board
who is not, as he considers, up to the mark.</q>
</p>

<p>
As they mustered on deck the captain’s eye ran with a
keen scrutiny over them. A slight smile crossed his lips as
he came to the two boys.
</p>

<p>
<q>That will do, Mr. Ayling; they are not a bad lot, taking
them one for all, and there are half a dozen men among
them who ought to make first-rate topmen. I should say
half of them have been to sea before, and the others will soon
be knocked into shape. The two boys will, of course, go
into the same mess as the others who have come on board.
One of them looks a very sharp young fellow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has been rather specially passed down, sir. He belonged
to one of the most noted smuggling villages on the
Yorkshire coast, which is saying a great deal, and he struck
against smuggling because some lady in the place told him
that it was wrong. Of course he drew upon himself the
enmity of the whole village. The coast-guard stopped a landing,
and two or three of the fishermen were killed. The
hostility against the lad, which was entirely unfounded, rose
in consequence of this to such a pitch that he was obliged to
take refuge in the coast-guard station. I hear from the captain
of the <name type="ship">Hearty</name> that the boy has been far better educated than
the generality of fisher lads, and was specially recommended
to him by the officer of the receiving-ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there anything extraordinary about the other boy?</q>
the captain asked with a slight smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir; I believe he joined chiefly to be near his companion,
the two being great friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He looks a different kind of boy altogether,</q> the captain
<pb n='51'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>said. <q>You could pick him out as a fisher boy anywhere, and
picture him in high boots, baggy corduroy breeches, and blue
guernsey.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a strong, well-built lad, and I should say a good
deal more powerful than his friend.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, they are good types of boys, and are not likely to
give us as much trouble as some of those young scamps, run-away
apprentices and so on, who want a rope’s end every
week or so to teach them to do their duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys were taken down to a deck below the water-level,
where the crew were just going to begin dinner. At one end
was a table at which six boys were sitting.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hillo, who are you?</q> the eldest among them asked. <q>I
warn you, if you don’t make things comfortable, you will get
your heads punched in no time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My name is William Gilmore, and this is Tom Stevens.
As to punching heads, you may not find it as easy as you
think. I may warn you at once that we are friends and will
stick together, and that there will be no punching one head
without having to punch both.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see about that before long,</q> the other said.
<q>Some of the others thought they were going to rule the
roost when they joined a few days ago, but I soon taught
them their place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you can begin to teach us ours as soon as you like,</q>
Tom Stevens said. <q>We have met bullies of your sort before.
Now, as dinner is going on, we will have some of it, as they
didn’t victual us before we left the cutter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, you had better go to the cook-house and draw
rations. No doubt the cook has a list of you fellows’ names.</q>
</p>

<pb n='52'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>

<p>
The boys took the advice and soon procured a cooked ration
of meat and potatoes. The cook told them where they would
find plates.
</p>

<p>
<q>One of the mess has to wash them up,</q> he said, <q>and
stow them away in the racks provided for them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Johnson,</q> the eldest boy said to the smallest of the party,
<q>you need not wash up to-day; that is the duty of the last
comer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose it is the duty of each one of the mess by turn,</q>
Will said quietly; <q>we learnt that much as we came down the
coast.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will have to learn more than that, young fellow,</q> the
bully, who was seventeen, blustered. <q>You will have to learn
that I am senior of the mess, and will have to do as I tell you.
I have made one voyage already, and all the rest of you are
greenhorns.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seems to me from the manner in which you speak, that
it is not a question of seniority but simply of bounce and
bullying, and I hope that the other boys will no more give in
to that sort of thing than Stevens or myself. I have yet to
learn that one boy is in any way superior to the others, and in
the course of the next hour I shall ascertain whether this is
so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps, after the meal is over, you will go down to the
lower deck and allow me to give you a lesson.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As I told you,</q> Will answered quietly, <q>my friend and I
are one. I don’t suppose that single-handed I could fight a great
hulking fellow like you, but my friend and I are quite willing
to do so together. So now if there is any talk of fighting, you
know what to expect.</q>
</p>

<pb n='53'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>

<p>
The bully eyed the two boys curiously, but, like most of the
type, he was at heart a coward, and felt considerable doubt
whether these two boys would not prove too much for him.
He therefore muttered sullenly that he would choose his own
time.
</p>

<p>
<q>All right! choose by all means, and whenever you like to
fix a time we shall be perfectly ready to accommodate you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who on earth are you with your long words? Are you a
gentleman in disguise?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind who I am,</q> Will said. <q>I have learnt enough,
at any rate, to know a bully and a coward when I meet him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lad was too furious to answer, but finished his dinner
in silence, his anger being all the more acute from the fact
that he saw that some of the other boys were tittering and
nudging each other. But he resolved that, though it might
be prudent for the present to postpone any encounter with
the boys, he would take his revenge on the first opportunity.

<head>CHAPTER III</head>

<head type="sub">A SEA-FIGHT</head>

<p>
As the conflict of words came to an end, a roar of laughter
burst from the sailors at the next mess-table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done, little bantam!</q> one said; <q>you have taken that
lout down a good many pegs, and I would not mind backing
you to thrash him single-handed. We have noticed his goings-on
for the past two or three days with the other boys, and had
<pb n='54'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>intended to give him a lesson, but you have done it right well.
He may have <anchor id="corr054"/><corr sic="been">been on</corr> a voyage before, but I would wager that
he has never been aloft, and I would back you to be at the
masthead before he has crawled through the lubbers’ hole.
Now, my lad, just you understand that if you are ready to
fight both those boys we won’t interfere, but if you try it one
on one of them we will.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys’ duties consisted largely of working with the
watch to which they were attached, of scrubbing decks, and
cleaning brass-work. In battle their place was to bring up
the powder and shot for the guns. On the second day, when
the work was done, Will Gilmore went up to the boatswain.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you please, sir,</q> he said, <q>may I go up the <anchor id="corr054a"/><corr sic="mast.">mast?</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
The boatswain looked at him out of one eye.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you really want to learn, lad?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, when there are, as at present, other hands aloft, you
may go up, but not at other times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir!</q>
</p>

<p>
Will at once started. He was accustomed to climb the
mast of John Hammond’s boat, but this was a very different
matter. From scrambling about the cliffs so frequently he
had a steady eye, and could look down without any feeling of
giddiness. The lubbers’ hole had been pointed out to him,
but he was determined to avoid the ignominy of having to go
up through it. When he got near it he paused and looked
round. It did not seem to him that there was any great
difficulty in going outside it, and as he knew he could trust
to his hands he went steadily up until he stood on the main-top.
</p>

<pb n='55'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>

<p>
<q>Hallo, lad,</q> said a sailor who was busy there, <q>do you
mean to say that you have come up outside?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there did not seem to be any difficulty about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And is it the first time you have tried?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then one day you will turn out a first-rate sailor. What
are you going to do now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Will looked up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going up to the top of the next mast.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are sure that you won’t get giddy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am accustomed to climbing up the cliffs on the
Yorkshire coast, and I have not the least fear of losing my
head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, fire away, lad, and if you find that you are
getting giddy shout and I will come up to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you! I will call if I want help.</q>
</p>

<p>
Steadily he went up till he stood on the cap of the topmast.
</p>

<p>
<q>I may as well go up one more,</q> he said. <q>I can’t think
why people make difficulties of what is so easy.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailor called to him as he saw him preparing to ascend
still higher, but Will only waved his hand and started up.
When he reached the cap of the top-gallant mast he sat
upon it and looked down at the harbour. Presently he
heard a hail from below, and saw the first lieutenant standing
looking up at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, sir! I will come down at once,</q> and steadily he
descended to the maintop, where the sailor who had spoken to
him abused him roundly. Then he went to where the lieutenant
was standing.
</p>

<p>
<q>How old are you, youngster?</q>
</p>

<pb n='56'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>

<p>
<q>I am a little past fifteen, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you ever been up a mast before?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never, sir, except that I have climbed up a fishing-boat’s
mast many a time, and I am accustomed to clambering about
the cliffs. I hope there was no harm in my going so high?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No harm as it has turned out. You are a courageous little
fellow; I never before saw a lad who went outside the lubbers’
hole on his first ascent. Well, I hope, my lad, that you will
be as well-behaved as you are active and courageous. I shall
keep my eye upon you, and you have my permission henceforth,
when you have no other duties, to climb about the masts
as you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant afterwards told the captain of Will’s exploit.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the sort of lad to make a good topman,</q> the
captain remarked. <q>He will soon be up to the duties, but
will have to wait to get some beef on him before he is of
much use in furling a sail.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very glad to have such a lad on board,</q> said the
lieutenant. <q>If we are at any station on the Mediterranean,
and have sports between the ships, I should back him against
any other boy in the fleet to get to the masthead and down
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
One of the midshipmen, named Forster, came up to Will
when he left the lieutenant, and said: <q>Well done, young un!
It was as much as I could do at your age, though I had been
two years in the navy, to climb up where you did. If there
is anything I can do for you at any time I will gladly do it.
I don’t say that it is likely, for midshipmen have no power to
speak of; still, if there should be anything I would gladly help
you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='57'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>

<p>
<q>There is something, if you would be so very good, sir.
I am learning navigation, but there are some things that I
can’t make out, and it would be a kindness indeed if you
would spare a few minutes occasionally to explain them to
me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The midshipman opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am blowed,</q> he exclaimed in intense astonishment.
<q>The idea of a newly-joined boy wanting to be helped in
navigation beats me altogether. However, lad, I will certainly
do as you ask me, though I cannot think that, unless you have
been at a nautical school, you can know anything about it.
But come to me this evening during the dog-watches, and
then I will see what you have learned about the subject.</q>
</p>

<p>
That evening Will went on deck rather shyly with two or
three of his books. The midshipman was standing at a quiet
spot on the deck. He glanced at Will enquiringly when he
saw what he was carrying.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you mean to say that you understand these books?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not altogether, sir. I think I could work out the latitude
and longitude if I knew something about a quadrant, but I
have never seen one, and have no idea of its use. But what
I wanted to ask you first of all was the meaning of some of
these words which I cannot find in the dictionary.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seems to me, youngster, that you know pretty well as
much as I do, for I cannot do more than fudge an observation.
How on earth did you learn all this? I thought you were
a fisher-boy before you joined.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So I was, sir. I was an orphan at the age of five.
My father left enough money to buy a boat, and, as one of
the fishermen had lately lost his, he adopted me, and I became
<pb n='58'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>bound to him as an apprentice till I was fourteen. The
clergyman’s daughter took a fancy to me from the first, and
she used to teach me for half an hour a day, which gave me
a great advantage over the other boys in the school. I was
very fond of reading, and she supplied me with books. As
I said I meant to go to sea, she bought me some books that
would help me. So there is nothing extraordinary in my
knowing these things; it all came from her kindness to me for
ten years.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn’t she try to get you into the mercantile
marine?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She got married and left the place, sir, but before she
went she told me that it was very wrong to have anything to
do with smugglers. So I decided to give it up, and that set
the whole village against me, and I should probably have been
killed if I had not taken refuge in the coast-guard station.
There the officer in charge spoke to me of joining the royal
navy, and it seemed to me that it would do me good to serve
a few years in it; for I could afterwards, if I chose, pass as an
officer in the merchant service.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are the rummest boy that I ever came across,</q> Forster
said. <q>Well, I must think it over. Now, if there is anything
that you specially wish to know, I will explain it to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
For half an hour they talked together, and the midshipman
solved many of the problems that had troubled the lad. Then
with many thanks Will went below.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it true, Will,</q> Tom Stevens said, <q>that you have been
right up the mast?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not exactly, Tom, but I went up to the top of the top-gallant
mast.</q>
</p>

<pb n='59'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>

<p>
<q>But why did you do that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wanted to get accustomed to going up. There was not
a bit of difficulty about it, except that it was necessary to
keep a steady head. You could do it just as well as I, for we
have climbed about the cliffs together scores of times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think it will do any good, Will?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I think so. When they see that a fellow is willing
and anxious to learn, it is sure to do him good in the long run.
It will help him on, and perhaps in two or three years he may
get rated as an able seaman, and no longer be regarded as a
boy, useful only to do odd jobs. One of the midshipmen is
going to give me some help with my navigation. I wish, Tom,
you would take it up too, but I am afraid it would be no
use. You have got to learn a tremendous lot before you can
master it, and what little you were taught at our school would
hardly help you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know that well enough, Will, and I should never think
of such a thing. I always was a fool, and could hardly take in
the little that old woman tried to teach us. No, it is of no use
trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. I hope that
soon I shall be able to hit a good round blow at a Frenchman;
that is about all I shall be fit for, though I hope I
may some day get to be a smart topman. The next time you
climb the mast I will go with you. I don’t think there is
enough in my head to make it unsteady. At any rate I think
that I can promise that I won’t do anything to bring discredit
upon you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The feat that Will had performed had a great effect upon
the bully of the mess. Before that he had frequently enjoyed
boasting of his experience in climbing, and even hinted that
<pb n='60'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>he had upon one occasion reached the masthead. Now no
more was heard of this, for, as Tom said openly, he was afraid
that Will might challenge him to a climbing-match. The next
evening the first lieutenant said to the captain: <q>That other
lad who was brought down from Yorkshire has been up the
mast with his chum this afternoon. As I told you, sir, I heard
that they were great friends, and Stevens did as well as the
other.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there is a great difference between them. The one
is as sharp and as bright as can be; the other is simply a
solidly-built fisher-boy who will, I have no doubt, make a good
sailor, but is not likely to set the Thames on fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, sir, Mr. Forster came to me this morning,
and told me that on his talking to the boy he astounded
him by asking if he would be kind enough to explain a few
things in navigation, as he had pretty well mastered all the
book-work, but had had no opportunity of learning the use of
a quadrant. Forster asked if I had any objection to his giving
him lessons. It is the first time that I ever heard of such a
request, and to allow it would be contrary to all idea of
discipline; still, a lad of that sort deserves encouragement, and
I will talk with the padre concerning him. He is one of the most
good-natured of men, and I think he would not mind giving
a quarter of an hour a day to this boy, after he has dismissed
the midshipmen from their studies. Of course he must do the
same work as the other boys, and no distinction must be made
between them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly not. I think the idea is an excellent one, and I
have not much doubt that Mr. Simpson will fall in with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
  The first lieutenant went off at once to find the <anchor id="corr060"/><corr sic="clergyman">clergyman.</corr>
</p>

<pb n='61'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>

<p>
<q>Well, he must be a strange boy,</q> the chaplain said when
the case was laid before him; <q>I should not be surprised if a
fellow like that found his way to the quarter-deck some day.
He appears to be a sort of admirable Crichton. Such an amount
of learning is extraordinary in a boy of his age and with his
opportunities, especially in one active and courageous enough
to go up to the cap of the top-gallant mast on his first trial in
climbing a mast. Certainly I shall be very glad to take the
boy on, and will willingly give him, as you say, a quarter of
an hour a day. I feel sure that my time will not be wasted.
I never before heard of a ship’s boy who wished to be instructed
in navigation, and I shall be glad to help such an
exceptional lad.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next day the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, having received all her stores,
went out to Spithead. The midshipmen had been all fully
engaged, and there were no lessons with the padre, but on the
following day these were resumed, and presently one of the
other boys came down with a message that Will was to go to
the padre’s cabin.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have arranged, lad,</q> the chaplain said when he entered,
<q>to give you a quarter of an hour a day to help you on with
your navigation, and I take it that you, on your part, are
ready to do the work. It seems to me almost out of the question
that you can be advanced enough to enter upon such
studies. That, however, I shall soon ascertain. Now open
that book and let me see how you would work out the following
<corr sic="no quote">observation,</corr></q> and he gave him the necessary data.
</p>

<p>
In five minutes Will handed him the result.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, sir, to obtain the exact answer I should require
to know more than you have given me.</q>
</p>

<pb n='62'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>

<p>
<q>That is quite right. To-morrow you shall go on deck
with me, and I will show you how to use a quadrant and
take the altitude of the sun, and from it how to calculate
the longitude, which is somewhat more difficult than the latitude.
I see you have a good knowledge of figures, and I am
quite sure that at the end of a few days’ work you will be
able to take an observation that will be close enough for all
practical purposes.</q>
</p>

<p>
He then asked Will many questions as to his course of study,
the books he had read, and the manner in which he had got
up the book-work of navigation.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how did you manage about logarithms,</q> he said. <q>I
generally find them great stumbling-blocks in the way of my
pupils.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t really understand them now, sir. I can look down
the columns and find the number I want, and see how it works
out the result, but why it should do so I have not been able to
understand. It seems quite different from other operations in
figures.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is so,</q> the chaplain said, <q>and let me tell you that not
one navigator in fifty really grasps the principle. They
<q>fudge</q>, as it is termed, the answer, and if they get it right
are quite content without troubling themselves in any way
with the principle involved. If you want to be a good
navigator you must grasp the principle, and work the answer
out for yourself. When you can do this you will have a right
to call yourself a navigator. If you come to me at twelve
o’clock to-morrow I will show you how to work a quadrant.
The theory is easy. You have but to take the angle the
sun makes with the horizon at its moment of highest
ascen<pb n='63'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>sion. In practice, however, this is far from easy, and you
will be some time before you can hit upon the right moment.
It requires patience and close observation, but if you have
these qualities you will soon pick it up.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailors were the next day greatly astonished at seeing
the chaplain take his place at the side of the ship and explain
to Will the methods of taking an observation.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Will was making rapid progress in the
good graces of the crew. He was always ready to render
assistance in running messages, in hauling on ropes, and
generally making himself useful in all respects. His fight
with Robert Jones had come off. Will had gained great confidence
in himself when he found that he was able to climb
the mast in the ordinary way, while Tom Stevens was able
only to crawl up through the lubbers’ hole. Goaded to madness
by the chaff of the other boys, all of whom had ranged
themselves under Will’s banner, Jones threw down the challenge.
Tom Stevens was most anxious that Will should not
take it up except on the conditions stated, but Will proclaimed
a profound contempt for the bully.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will try it myself, Tom. I can hardly fail to lick such
a braggart as that. I don’t believe he has any muscles to
speak of in that big body of his, while I am as hard as nails.
No doubt it will be a tough fight if he has a scrap of pluck
in him, but I think I will win. Besides, if he does beat me,
he will certainly get little credit for it, while I shall have
learnt a lot that will be useful to me in the next fight.</q>
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, at the time appointed the two lads went down
to the orlop deck, a good many of the sailors accompanying
them. An ordinary fight between boys attracted little
atten<pb n='64'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>tion, but the disparity between the years of the combatants,
and the liking entertained for Will, brought most of those
who were off duty to witness it. The difference between the
antagonists when they stripped was very marked. Robert
Jones was fully three stone the heavier and four inches the
taller, but he was flabby and altogether out of condition, while
Will was as hard as nails, and as active on his feet as a kid.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is ten to one against the young un,</q> one of the men
said, <q>but if he holds on for the first five rounds I would back
him at evens.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So would I,</q> another said, <q>but I doubt whether he can
do so; the odds are too great against him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will take four to one,</q> another said. <q>Look at the
young un’s muscles down his back. You won’t often see anything
better among lads two years older than he is.</q>
</p>

<p>
The fight began with a tremendous rush on the part of
Jones. Will stood his ground doggedly, and struck his
opponent fairly between the eyes, making him shake his head
like an exasperated bull. Time after time Jones repeated
the manœuvre, but only once or twice landed a blow, while he
never escaped without a hard return. At length he began to
feel the effects of his own efforts, and stood on the defensive,
panting for breath. Now it was Will’s turn. He danced
round and round his opponent with the activity of a goat,
dodging in and delivering a heavy body-blow and then leaping
out again before his opponent could get any return. The
cheers of the sailors rose louder and louder, and Will heard
them shouting: <q>Go in; finish him, lad!</q> But Will was too
prudent to risk anything; he knew that the battle was in his
hands unless he threw it away, and that Jones was well-nigh
<pb n='65'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>pumped out. At last, after dealing a heavy blow, he saw his
antagonist stagger back, and in an instant sprang forward and
struck him between the eyes with far greater force than he
had before exerted. Jones fell like a log, and was altogether
unable to come up to time. A burst of cheering rose from
the crowd, and many and hearty were the congratulations
Will received.

<p>
<q>What was going on this afternoon, Mr. Farrance?</q> asked
the captain; <q>I heard a lot of cheering.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I made enquiry about it, sir, and the boatswain told
me that it was only a fight between two of the boys. Of
course he had not been present.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! It is not often that a boys’ fight excites such interest.
Who were they?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They were Jones, the biggest of the boys, and by no
means a satisfactory character, and young Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, Jones is big enough to eat him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, at any rate he ought to have been. He was a
great bully when he first came on board, but the other tackled
him as soon as they were together, and it seems he has to-day
given him as handsome a thrashing as could be wished for,
and that without being seriously hurt himself. He has
certainly established his supremacy among the boys of this
ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That boy is out of the common,</q> the captain said. <q>A
ship’s boy newly joined taking up navigation, going about
the masts like a monkey, and finally thrashing a fellow two
years his senior must be considered as altogether exceptional.
I shall certainly keep my eye upon him, and give him every
opportunity I can for making his way.</q>
</p>

<pb n='66'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>

<p>
Will received his honours quietly.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is nothing,</q> he said, <q>in fighting a fellow who is
altogether out of condition, and has a very small amount of
pluck to make up for it. I was convinced when we first met
that he had nothing behind his brag, though I certainly did
not expect to beat him as easily as I did. Well, I hope we
shall be good friends in future. I have no enmity against
him, and there is no reason why we should not get on well
together after this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know,</q> said the sailor to whom he was speaking;
<q>a decent fellow will make it up and think no more about it,
but if I am not mistaken, Robert Jones will do you a bad turn
if he gets the chance.</q>
</p>

<p>
No one was more delighted at the result than Tom Stevens,
who had cheered loudly and enthusiastically. Dimchurch was
also exuberant at Will’s success.
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew that you were a good un, but I never thought
you could have tackled that fellow. I don’t know what to
make of you; as a general thing, as far as I have seen, a
fellow who takes to books is no good for anything else, but
everything seems to agree with you. If I am not mistaken,
you will be on the quarter-deck before many years have
passed.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were now running down channel, and the boys were
astonished at the ease and smoothness with which the ship
breasted the waves, and at the mass of snowy canvas that
towered above her. As they sat one day at the bow watching
the sheets of spray rise as the ship cut her way through the
water, Tom said to his friend: <q>You are going up above me
quick, Will. Anyone can see that. You are thought a lot of.
<pb n='67'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>I knew it would be so, and I said I should not grudge it you;
in fact, the greater your success the better I shall be pleased.
But I did not think that your learning would have made such
a difference already. The first lieutenant often says a word
to you as he passes, and the padre generally speaks to you
when he goes along the deck. It is wonderful what a difference
learning makes; not, mind you, that I should ever have gone
in for it, even had I known how useful it is. I could never
have taken it in, and I am sure the old woman could never
have taught me. I suppose some fellows are born clever and
others grow to it. And some never are clever at all. That
was my way, I suppose. I just learned to spell words of two
letters, which, of course, was of no use. A fellow can’t do
much with ba, be, by, and bo, and these are about all the
words I remember. I used to think, when we first became
chums, how foolish you were to be always reading and studying.
Now I see what a pull you have got by it. I expect
it is partly because your father was a clever man, and, as most
of the people thought, a gentleman, that you came to take to it.
Well, if I had my time over again I would really try to learn
something. I should never make much of it, but still, I suppose
I should have got to read decently.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly you would, Tom; and when you once had got
to read, so as to be able to enjoy it, you would have gone
through all sorts of books and got lots of information from
them. I am afraid, however, it is too late to worry over
that. A man may be a good man and a good sailor without
knowing how to read and write. I am sure you will do your
share when it comes to that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wonder when we shall fall in with a Frenchman?</q>
</p>

<pb n='68'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>

<p>
<q>There is no saying. You may be sure that every man on
board is longing to do so. I hope she will be a bit bigger
than we are, and I know the captain hopes so too. He is for
ever watching every ship that comes in sight.</q>
</p>

<p>
When running down the coast of Spain one day the look-out
at the masthead shouted: <q>A sail!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is she like?</q> the first lieutenant hailed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can only see her top-gallant sails, sir, but she is certainly
a square-rigged ship bound south, and her sails have a foreign
cut.</q>
</p>

<p>
The first lieutenant swung his telescope over his shoulder
and mounted the rigging. When he came to the top-gallant
crosstrees he sat down and gazed into the distance through his
glass.
</p>

<p>
After making a careful examination of the ship he called to
the captain, who was now on deck:
</p>

<p>
<q>She is, as Johnson says, sir, a square-rigged ship, and I
agree with him as to the cut of her sails. She is certainly a
Frenchman, and evidently a large frigate. She is running
down the coast as we are, and I expect hopes to get through
the Straits at night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, edge in towards her,</q> the captain said. <q>Lower
the top-gallant sails. If she hasn’t already made us out, I
shall be able to work in a good deal closer to her before she
does so.</q>
</p>

<p>
All hands were now on the <hi rend='italic'>qui vive</hi>, but it was not for
some time that the stranger could be made out from the
deck.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can get up our top-gallant sails again,</q> the captain
said. <q>She must have made us out by this time, and she
<pb n='69'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>certainly has gained upon us since we first saw her. There is
no longer any possibility of concealment, so hoist royals as
well as top-gallant sails.</q>
</p>

<p>
The stranger made no addition to her sails. By this time
those on board the <name type="ship">Furious</name> were able to judge of her size, and
came to the conclusion that she was a battle-ship of small
size, and ought to be more than a match for the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. The
vessels gradually approached each other, until at last a shot
was thrown across the bows of the Frenchman. She made no
reply, but continued on her way as if unconscious of the
presence of the English frigate. The crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> could
now make out that she had fifty guns, whereas their own ship
had thirty-four.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just comfortable odds,</q> the captain said quietly when this
was reported to him. <q>I have no doubt she carries heavier
metal as well as more guns. Altogether she would be a satisfactory
prize to send into Portsmouth.</q>
</p>

<p>
The men had not waited for orders, but had mustered to
quarters on their own account. The guns were run in and
loaded, and the boarding-pikes got ready. In five minutes
orders were given to fire another shot. There was a cheer as
white splinters were seen to fly from the Frenchman’s side.
Her helm was put up at once, and she swept round and fired
a broadside into the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. Four or five shots took effect,
some stays and ropes were cut, and two shot swept across her
deck, killing three of the sailors and knocking down several of
the others.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aim steadily, lads,</q> the captain shouted; <q>don’t throw
away a shot. It is our turn now. All aim at her centre ports.
Fire!</q>
</p>

<pb n='70'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>

<p>
The ship swayed from the recoil of the guns, and then she
swung half-round and a broadside was poured into the
Frenchman from the other side.
</p>

<p>
After this Will and Tom knew little more of what was
going on, for they were kept busy running to and from the
magazine with fresh cartridges. They were not tall enough to
see over the bulwarks, and were only able to peep out occasionally
from one of the port-holes. They presently heard from
the shouts and exclamations of the men that everything was
going well, and on looking out they saw that the enemy’s
foremast had been shot away, and in consequence she was
unmanageable. The crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> had suffered heavily,
but her main spars were intact, and the captain, manœuvring
with great skill, was able to sail backwards and forwards across
the enemy’s stern and rake him repeatedly fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
So the fight continued until at last the captain gave
the order to lay the ship alongside the Frenchman and board.
There was no more work for the powder-monkeys now, so
Will and Tom seized boarding-pikes and joined in the rush
on to the enemy’s deck. The resistance, however, was short-lived;
the enemy had suffered terribly from the raking fire
of the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, and as the captain and many of the officers had
fallen, the senior survivor soon ordered the flag to be lowered.
A tremendous cheer broke from the British. They now
learned that the ship they had captured was the <name type="ship">Proserpine</name>,
which was on her way to enter the Mediterranean and effect
a junction with the French fleet at Toulon.
</p>

<p>
The next day the crew worked hard to get up a jury foremast.
When this was done a prize crew was put on board.
The French prisoners were confined below, as they far
out<pb n='71'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>numbered their captors. Then, having repaired her own
damages, the <name type="ship">Furious</name> proceeded on her way.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at Gibraltar the captain received orders to proceed
to Malta, and to place himself under the order of the
admiral there. For a time matters proceeded quietly, for the
winds were light and baffling, and it took a fortnight to get
to their destination. Here the ship was thoroughly examined,
and the damage she had suffered more satisfactorily repaired
than had been possible while she was at sea.
</p>

<p>
When the overhauling was completed she received orders
to cruise off the coast of Africa. This was by no means
pleasing to the crew, who considered that they had small
chance of falling in with anything of their own size on that
station. They were told, however, that there had been serious
complaints of piracy on the part of the Moors, and that they
were specially to direct their attention to punishing the perpetrators
of such acts.
</p>

<p>
One morning three strange craft were sighted lying close
together. Unfortunately, however, it was a dead calm.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are Moors, certainly,</q> the captain said to the first
lieutenant after examining them with his glass. <q>What would
I not give for a breath of wind now? But they are not going
to escape us. Get all the boats hoisted out, and take command
of the expedition yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Immediately all was bustle on board the ship, and in a very
short time every boat was lowered into the water. Will was
looking on with longing eyes as the men took their places.
The lieutenant noticed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Clamber down into the bow of my boat,</q> he said; <q>you
deserve it.</q>
</p>

<pb n='72'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>

<p>
In the highest state of delight Will seized a spare cutlass
and made his way into the bow of the boat amid the jokes of
the men. These, however, were stilled the moment the first
lieutenant took his place in the stern.
</p>

<p>
The Moors had not been idle. As soon as they saw that
the boats had been lowered they got out their sweeps and
began to row at a pace which the lieutenant saw would tax
the efforts of his oarsmen to the utmost. The Moors had
fully three miles start, and, although the men bent to their oars
with the best will, they gained very slowly. The officers in
the various boats encouraged them with their shouts, and the
men pulled nobly. Five miles had been passed and but one
mile gained. It was evident, however, that the efforts of the
Moorish rowers were flagging, while the sailors were rowing
almost as strongly as when they started. Three more miles
and another mile had been gained. Then from the three
vessels came a confused fire of cannon of all sizes.
</p>

<p>
Several men were hit, boats splintered, and oars smashed.
The first lieutenant shouted orders for the boats to open out
so that the enemy would no longer have a compact mass
to aim at. At last, after another mile, the Moors evidently
came to the conclusion that they could not escape by rowing,
and at once drew in their oars, lowered their sails, and all
formed in line. As soon as this manœuvre was completed
heavy firing began again. Will, lying in the bow, looked out
ahead, and, seeing the sea torn up with balls, wondered that
any of the boats should escape unharmed.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant shouted to the boats to divide into two parties,
one, led by himself, to attack the vessel on the left of the
line, and the other, under the second lieutenant, to deal with
<pb n='73'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>the ship on the right, for the middle boat would assuredly be
captured if the other two were taken.
</p>

<p>
<q>Row quietly, men,</q> he shouted; <q>you will want your
breath if it comes to fighting. Keep on at a steady pace
until within two hundred yards of them, and then make
a dash.</q>
</p>

<p>
This order was carried out by both parties, and when within
the given distance the men gave a cheer, and, bending their
backs to the oars, sent the boats tearing through the water.
The pirate craft were all crowded with men, who raised yells
of rage and defiance. However, except that one boat was
sunk by a shot that struck her full in the bow, Lieutenant
Farrance’s party reached their vessel.
</p>

<p>
The first to try to climb on board were all cut down or
thrown backwards, but at length the men gained a footing
on the deck, and, led by Mr. Farrance, fell upon the enemy
with great spirit. Will was the last to climb up out of his
boat, but he soon pushed his way forward until he was close
behind the lieutenant. Several times the boarders were
pushed back, but as often they rallied, and won their way
along the deck again.
</p>

<p>
During one of these rushes Lieutenant Farrance’s foot slipped
in a pool of blood, and he fell to the deck. Two Moors sprang
at him, but Will leapt forward, whirling his cutlass, and by
luck rather than skill cut down one of them. The other
attacked him and dealt him a severe blow on the arm, but
before he could repeat it the lieutenant had regained his feet,
and, springing forward, had run the Moor through the body.
</p>

<p>
Another five minutes’ fighting and all resistance was at an
end. Some of the Moors rushed below, others jumped
over<pb n='74'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>board and swam to their consort. As soon as resistance had
ceased the lieutenant ordered the majority of the men to
return to the boats, and, leaving a sufficient number to hold
the captured vessel, proceeded to the attack of the middle
craft.
</p>

<p>
The fight here was even more stubborn than before, for the
men that fled from the ships that had already been taken had
strongly reinforced the crew of this one. The British, however,
were not to be denied. The boats of one division
attacked on one side, those of the second on the other, and,
after nearly a quarter of an hour’s hard fighting, brought the
enemy to their knees.
</p>

<p>
The pirates were all now battened down, the wounded
seamen cared for by the doctor who had accompanied the
expedition, and the bodies of the dead Moors thrown overboard.
When this was done the successful expedition prepared
to return to the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. They had lost twenty-eight killed,
and nearly forty wounded.
</p>

<p>
<q>The loss has been very heavy,</q> the first lieutenant said
when the return was given to him; <q>and to do the fellows
justice they fought desperately. Well, now we have to get
back to the ship, which is a good ten miles away. She is still
becalmed, and so are we, and unless the wind springs up we
shall hardly reach her before nightfall. I don’t like to ask
the men for more exertions after a ten miles row at such a
ripping pace; still, it must be done. Let two boats take each
of the pirates in tow; they shall be relieved every hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailors, who were in high glee at their success, took
their places in the boats cheerfully, but when night fell they
were still more than four miles away from the frigate.

<head>CHAPTER IV</head>

<head type="sub">PROMOTED</head>

<p>
The lieutenant took a boat when it became dusk and rowed
to the frigate, where he handed in his report of the fight.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will read that later, Mr. Farrance,</q> the captain said.
<q>Meanwhile, tell me briefly what is the result? Of course I
saw you returning with the three vessels in tow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We had a very sharp fight, sir, and I am sorry to say that
the casualties are heavy, twenty-eight killed and nearly forty
wounded more or less severely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a heavy list indeed, Mr. Farrance, very heavy, and
we are the less able to bear it since we have some seventy men
away on the French prize. The rascals must have fought
desperately.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They did, sir. I am bound to say that men could hardly
have fought better. We had very hard work with the two
outside ships, and as most of the fellows jumped overboard
and swam to the other, we had an even stiffer fight there. In
fact, if we had had only one of our division of boats available
I am sure we should not have carried her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are the casualties among the officers?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Midshipman Howard is killed, sir, and Lieutenant Ayling
and Midshipman James very severely wounded. I myself
had a very narrow escape. I slipped upon some blood, and
two Moors rushed at me and would have killed me had not
that boy Gilmore thrown himself between us. He waved
his cutlass about wildly, and, principally from good luck, I
<pb n='76'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>think, cut down one of them. On this the other attacked
him, and I had time to get to my feet again. As soon as I
was up I ran the Moor through, but not before he had given
the boy a very ugly wound on the arm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a wonderful boy,</q> the captain said with a smile.
<q>I think he is too good to remain where he is, and I must put
him on the quarter-deck.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should feel greatly obliged if you would, sir, for there
is no doubt that he saved my life. He is certainly as well up
in his work as any of the midshipmen. The chaplain told me
only yesterday that he had learnt to use the quadrant, and can
take an observation quite as accurately as most of his pupils.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Such a boy as that,</q> said the captain, <q>ought to be given
a chance of rising in his profession. He is quite at home aloft,
and may be fairly called a sailor. He is certainly a favourite
with the whole crew, and I think, if promoted, will give every
satisfaction. Very well, Farrance, we may consider that as
settled.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much, sir! I need hardly say that it
will be a pleasure to me to fit him out.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning there was a light breeze, and the three
prizes, which had remained four miles from the frigate through
the night, closed up to her. The wounded were transhipped,
and a prize crew was told off to each of the captures, a considerable
portion of the Moors being also transferred to the
frigate and sent down into the hold.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon Will, to his surprise, received word that
the captain wished to speak to him. His jacket had been cut
off and his injured arm was in a sling, so he could only throw
the garment over his shoulders before he hurried aft. When
<pb n='77'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>he reached the poop he found that the crew were mustered,
and in much trepidation as to his appearance, and with a great
feeling of wonder as to why he had been sent for, he made his
way to where the captain was standing surrounded by a group
of officers.
</p>

<p>
<q>Men,</q> the captain said in a loud clear voice, <q>I am going
to take a somewhat unusual step, and raise one of your comrades
to the quarter-deck. Still more unusual is it that such
an honour should fall to a ship’s boy. In this case, however,
I am sure you will all agree with me that the boy in question
has distinguished himself not only by his activity and keenness
aloft, but by the fact that he has, under great difficulties,
educated himself, and in manner and education is perfectly
fit to be a messmate of the midshipmen of this vessel. Moreover,
in the fight yesterday he saved the life of Lieutenant
Farrance when he had fallen and was attacked by two of the
Moors. One of these the lad killed, and the other he engaged.
This gave Lieutenant Farrance time to recover his feet, and
he quickly disposed of the second Moor, not, however, before
the rascal had inflicted a severe wound on the lad. Mr.
William Gilmore, I have real pleasure in nominating you a
midshipman on board His Majesty’s ship <name type="ship">Furious</name>, and inviting
you to join us on the quarter-deck.</q>
</p>

<p>
The cheer that broke from the men showed that they
heartily approved of the honour that had fallen upon their
young comrade. As to Will himself, he was so surprised and
overcome by this most unexpected distinction that he could
scarcely speak. The captain stepped forward and shook him
by the hand, an example followed by the other officers and
midshipmen.
</p>

<pb n='78'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>

<p>
<q>You had better retire,</q> the captain said, seeing that the
lad was quite unable to speak, <q>and when you have recovered
from your wound the ship’s tailor will take your uniform in
hand. Lieutenant Farrance has kindly expressed his intention
of providing you with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will, with the greatest difficulty, restrained his feelings till
he reached the sick berth, and then he threw himself into a
hammock and burst into tears. Presently Tom Stevens came
in to see him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad, Will,</q> he said, <q>more glad than I can possibly
express. It is splendid to think that you are really an
officer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is too much altogether, Tom. I had hoped that some
day I might come to be a mate, or even a captain in a
merchant ship, but to think that in less than two months after
joining I could be on the quarter-deck was beyond my wildest
dreams. Well I hope I sha’n’t get puffed up, and I am sure,
Tom, that I shall be as much your friend as ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t doubt that, Will; you would not be yourself if it
made any difference in you. Dimchurch asked me to tell you
how much he too was pleased, but that he was not surprised
at all, for he felt sure that in less than a year you would be on
the quarter-deck, as it would be ridiculous that anyone who
could take an observation and be at the same time one of the
smartest hands aloft should remain in the position of ship’s
boy. One of the elder sailors said that in all his experience
he had never known but three or four cases of men being
promoted from the deck except when old warrant officers were
made mates and appointed to revenue cutters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank Dimchurch very heartily for me, Tom, and tell him
<pb n='79'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>that I hope we shall sail many years together, although it may
be in different parts of the ship. Now I will lie quiet for a
time, for my arm is throbbing dreadfully. The doctor tells me
that although the wound is severe it can hardly be called
serious, for with so good a constitution as I have it will heal
quickly, and in a month I shall be able to use it as well as
before.</q>
</p>

<p>
The agitation and excitement, however, acted injuriously,
and the next day Will was in a state of high fever, which did
not abate for some days, and left him extremely weak.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have had a sharp bout of it, lad,</q> the doctor said,
<q>but you are safe now, and you will soon pick up strength
again. It has had one good effect; it has kept you from
fidgeting over your wound, and I have no doubt that, now
the fever has left you, you will go on nicely.</q>
</p>

<p>
In another three weeks Will was able to leave the sick bay,
and on the morning he was discharged from the sick list he
found by his hammock two suits of midshipman’s uniform, a
full dress and a working suit, together with a pile of shirts
and underclothing of all kinds, and two or three pairs of shoes.
His other clothes had been taken away, so he dressed himself
in the working suit, and with some little trepidation made his
way to his new quarters. The midshipmen were just sitting
down to breakfast, and, rising, they all shook hands with him
and congratulated him heartily both on his promotion and his
recovery.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are very good to welcome me so heartily,</q> he said.
<q>I know that neither by birth nor station am I your equal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite our equal, youngster,</q> said one of the midshipmen,
<q>whatever you may be by birth. Not one of us
<pb n='80'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>could have worked half so well as you have done; the chaplain
tells us that you can take an observation as well as he can.
I can assure you we are all heartily glad to have you with us.
Sit down and make yourself at home. We have not much to
offer you besides our rations; for we have been out for over a
month, and our soft tack and all other luxuries were finished
long ago, so we are reduced to ham and biscuit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It could not be better,</q> Will said with a smile, <q>for I
have got such an appetite that I could eat horse with satisfaction.
I feel immensely indebted to you, Mr. Forster; for if
you had not brought my request before the first lieutenant I
should not have been able to make such progress with my
books as I have done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The chaplain is a first-rate fellow—but, by the way, we
have no misters here; we all call each other by our surname
plain and simple. Even Peters, who has welcomed you in our
name and who is a full-fledged master’s mate, does not claim to
be addressed as mister, though he will probably do so before
long, for the wound of Lieutenant Ayling, who, it is settled,
will be invalided when we get to Malta, will give him his step.
On that occasion we will solemnly drink his health, at his own
expense of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is not the ordinary way,</q> the mate laughed. <q>I
know that you fellows will be game to shell out a bottle
apiece—I don’t think I can do it—not at least until I get
three months of my new rate of pay.</q>
</p>

<p>
So they laughed and chaffed, and Will felt grateful to them,
for he saw that it was in no small degree due to the desire to
set him at his ease.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will be in the starboard watch, Gilmore,</q> the mate
<pb n='81'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>said when the meal was finished. <q>That was the one Ayling
had. The third lieutenant, Bowden, who is now in charge,
isn’t half a bad fellow. Of course he is a little cocky—third
lieutenants on their first commission generally are, but he is
kind-hearted and likes to makes himself popular, and he will
wink one eye when you take a nap under a gun, which is no
mean virtue. The boatswain, who is in the same watch, is a
much more formidable person, and busies himself quite unnecessarily.
One cannot, however, have everything, and on
the whole you will get on very comfortably. I am in the
other watch, Rodwell and Forster are with you. They are
well-meaning lads; I don’t know that I can say anything more
for them, but you will find out their faults soon enough yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will then went up on deck with the others. It seemed
strange to him to enter upon what he had hitherto regarded
as a sort of sacred ground, and he stood shyly aside while the
others fell into their duties of looking after the men and
seeing that the work was being done. Presently the first
lieutenant came on deck. Will went up to him and touched
his hat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot tell you, sir,</q> he said, <q>how indebted I feel to
you for your kindness in speaking for me to the captain, and
especially in providing me with an outfit. I can assure you,
sir, that as long as I live I shall remember your kindness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My lad, these things weigh but little against the saving of
my life, and I can assure you that it was a great satisfaction to
me to be able to make this slight return. I shall watch your
career with the greatest interest, for I am convinced that it
will be a brilliant one.</q>
</p>

<pb n='82'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>

<p>
Owing to the fact that two officers had gone away in their
first prize, and that three had been killed or disabled in the
late fight, there was a shortage of officers on the <name type="ship">Furious</name>.
Three had left in the Moorish prizes, and when, a week later,
another Moorish vessel was captured without much fighting,
the captain had no officers to spare above the rank of midshipmen.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Forster,</q> he said, <q>I have selected you to go in the
prize. You can take one of the juniors with you; I cannot
spare either of the seniors. Who would you like to take?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather have Gilmore, sir. I feel that I can trust
him thoroughly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think you have made a good choice. I cannot spare you
more than thirty men. You will go straight to Malta, hand
over your prize to the agent there, and either wait till we
return, or come back again if there should be any means of
doing so.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will was delighted when he heard that he was to go with
Forster. <q>Will you pick the crew?</q> he asked his friend.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, but I could arrange without difficulty for anyone you
specially wished.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like very much to have my friend Tom Stevens
and the sailor named Dimchurch; they are both good hands in
their way, and were very friendly with me before I got promoted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right! there will no difficulty about that; we shall
want a boy to act as our servant, and one able seaman is as
good as another. I have noticed Dimchurch; he is a fine
active hand, and I will appoint him boatswain.</q>
</p>

<p>
Great was the pride of Will as the prize crew rowed from
<pb n='83'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>the <name type="ship">Furious</name> to the Moorish galley of which he was to be
second in command, but he could not help bursting out laughing
as he went down with Forster into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you laughing at?</q> Forster asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was having a bit of a laugh at the thought of the change
that has come over my position. Not that I am conceited
about it, but it all seems so strange that I should be here and
second in command.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt it does,</q> laughed Forster, <q>but you will soon
get accustomed to it. It is almost as strange for me, for it is
the first time that I have been in command. I have brought
a chart on board with me. Our course is north-north-east,
and the distance is between two and three hundred miles. In
any decent part of the world we should do it in a couple
of days, but with these baffling winds we may take a week
or more. Well, I don’t much care how long we are; it will
be a luxury to be one’s own master for a bit.</q>
</p>

<p>
The first step was to divide the crew into two watches.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am entitled not to keep a watch,</q> Forster said, <q>but I
shall certainly waive the privilege. We will take a watch
each.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tom Stevens was appointed cabin servant, and one of the men
was made cook; nine of the others were told off to each watch.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish she hadn’t all those prisoners on board,</q> Forster
said. <q>They will be a constant source of anxiety. There
are over fifty of them, and as hang-dog scoundrels as one
would wish to see. We shall have to keep a sharp look-out
on them, to make sure that they don’t get a ghost of a chance
of coming up on deck, for if they did they would not think
twice about cutting our throats.</q>
</p>

<pb n='84'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>

<p>
<q>I don’t see how they could possibly get out,</q> Will said.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it generally does look like that, but they manage it
sometimes for all that. These fellows know that when they
get to Malta they will be set to work in the yards, and if
there was an opportunity, however small, for them to break
out, you may be sure that they would take it. These Moorish
pirates are about as ruffianly scoundrels as are to be found,
and if they don’t put their prisoners to death they only spare
them for what they will fetch as slaves.</q>
</p>

<p>
After three days’ sailing they had made but little way, for
it was only in the morning and the evening that there was
any breeze. Will had just turned in for the middle watch,
and had scarcely dropped to sleep, when he was suddenly
awakened by a loud noise. He sprang out of bed, seized his
dirk and a brace of pistols which were part of the equipment
given him by the first lieutenant. As he ran up the companion
he heard a coil of rope thrown against the door, so
he leapt down again and ran with all speed to the men’s
quarters. They, too, were all on their feet, but the hatch had
been battened down above them.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is a bad job, sir,</q> Dimchurch said. <q>How they have
got out I have no idea. I looked at the fastenings of the
two hatches when I came down twenty minutes ago, and they
looked to me all right. I am afraid they will cut all our
comrades’ throats.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I fear so, Dimchurch. What do you think we had better
do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know, sir; it will require a good deal of thinking
out. I don’t suppose they will meddle with us at present, but
of course they will sooner or later.</q>
</p>

<pb n='85'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>

<p>
<q>Well, Dimchurch, as a first step we will bring all the
mess tables and other portable things forward here, and
make a barricade with them. We will also obtain two or
three barrels of water and a stock of food, so that when
the time comes we may at any rate be able to make a stout
resistance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a good idea, sir. We will set to work at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a short time, with the aid of tubs of provisions, barrels
of water, and bales of goods, a barricade was built across the
bow of the vessel, forming a triangular enclosure of about
fourteen feet on each side. The arms were then collected
and placed inside, and when this was done there was a general
feeling of satisfaction that they could at least sell their lives
dearly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, sir, what is the next step?</q> Dimchurch asked.
<q>You have only to give your orders and we are ready to carry
them out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have thought of nothing at present,</q> Will said. <q>I fancy
it will be better to allow them to make the first move, for
even with the advantage of attacking them in the dark we
could hardly hope to overcome four times our number.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be a tough job certainly, sir; but if the worst
comes to the worst, we might try it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must come to quite the worst, Dimchurch, before we
take such a step as that.</q>
</p>

<p>
As evening approached, the Moors were heard descending
the companion. There was a buzz of talk, and then they came
rushing forward. When they reached the door between the
fore and aft portions of the ship Will and his men opened fire
upon them, and as they poured out they were shot down.
<pb n='86'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>Seven or eight fell, and then the others dashed forward.
The seamen lined the barricade and made a strenuous resistance.
Cutlass clashed against Moorish yatagan; the Moors
were too crowded together to use their guns, and as they
could gather no more closely in front than the sailors stood,
they were unable to break through the barricade. At last,
after many had fallen, the rest retired. Three or four of the
sailors had received more or less severe wounds, but none
were absolutely disabled. Tom Stevens had fought pluckily
among the rest, and Will was ready with his shouts of encouragement,
and a cutlass he had taken for use instead of his
dirk, wherever the pressure was most severe.
</p>

<p>
When the Moors had retired, Dimchurch and two others
went outside the barricade and piled some heavy bales against
the door, after first carrying out the dead Moors.
</p>

<p>
<q>They will hardly attack us that way again, sir,</q> he said to
Will; <q>it will be our turn next time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, six of their number are killed, and probably several
badly wounded, so we ought to have a good chance of success
if we make a dash at them in the dark.</q>
</p>

<p>
They waited until night had fallen. Then Will said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think you can lift that hatchway, Dimchurch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will have a pretty hard try anyhow,</q> the man said. <q>I
will roll this tub under it; that will give me a chance of using
my strength.</q>
</p>

<p>
Although he was able to move it slightly, his utmost efforts
failed to lift it more than an inch or two.
</p>

<p>
<q>They have piled too many ropes on it for me, sir; but I
think that if some others will get on tubs and join me we
shall be able to move the thing.</q>
</p>

<pb n='87'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>

<p>
<q>Wait a minute, Dimchurch. Let each man make sure that
his musket is loaded.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, during which all firelocks were
carefully examined. When he saw that all were in good
order, Will said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, lads, heave away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Slowly the hatchway yielded, and with a great effort it was
pushed up far enough for a man to crawl out. Pieces of wood
were shoved in at each corner so as to hold the hatch open,
and the men who had lifted it stood clear.
</p>

<p>
<q>Clamber out, Dimchurch, and have a look round. Are
there many of them on deck?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only about a dozen, as far as I can make out, sir. They
are jabbering away among themselves disputing, I should
say, as to the best way to get at us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expect they intend to leave us alone and take us into
Algiers. However, that does not matter. You two crawl
out and lie down, then give me a hand and hoist me out.
I think the others can all reach, except Tom; you had better
hoist him up after me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Each man, as he clambered out, lay down on the deck.
When all were up, they crawled along aft to within a few
yards of the Moors, then leapt to their feet and fired a volley.
Five of the Moors fell, while the others, panic-stricken, ran
below.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, pile cables over the hatchway,</q> Will shouted.
</p>

<p>
The sailors rushed to carry out the order. They were
startled as they did so by a shout from above.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hillo, below there! Have you got possession of the ship?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Is that you, Forster?</q>
</p>

<pb n='88'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God for that!</q> Will shouted back, while the men
gave a cheer. <q>Why don’t you come down?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going to slide down the mast.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What for? Why don’t you come down by the rattlings?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have cut the shrouds. When our last man fell I made
a dash for them, and directly I got to the top I cut them, and
half a dozen men who were climbing after me fell sprawling
to the deck. Then I cut them on the other side. I thought
then that they would at once shoot me, but there was a lively
argument among them and shouts of laughter, and they
evidently thought that it would be a great joke to leave me
up here until I chose to slide down and be killed. Of course
I heard their attack on you, and trembled for the result;
but when the noise suddenly ceased I guessed that you had
repulsed them. Well, here goes!</q> and half a minute later he
slid down to the deck. <q>How do matters stand?</q> he asked,
when he stood among them.
</p>

<p>
<q>We killed six and wounded eight or ten in the first attack
upon us, and we have shot five more now. All the rest are
battened down below.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There they had better remain for the present. Well,
Gilmore, I congratulate you on having recaptured the ship.
It has been a bad affair, for we have lost nine men killed; but
as far as you are concerned you have done splendidly. I am
afraid I shall get a pretty bad wigging for allowing them to
get out, though certainly the bolts of the hatchways were all
right when we changed the watch. Of course I see now that
I ought to have placed a man there as sentry. It is always so
mighty easy to be wise after the event. I expect the rascals
<pb n='89'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>pretty nearly cut the wood away round the bolts, and after
the watch was changed set to work and completed the job.
We shall not, however, be able to investigate that until we
get to Malta.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have blocked up the door between the fore and the
after parts of the ship,</q> said Will; <q>but I think it would be
as well to place a sentry at each hatch now, as they might turn
the tables upon us again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly. Are you badly wounded, Dimchurch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have got a slash across the cheek, sir, but nothing to
speak of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, will you take post at the after-hatch for the present.
Stevens, you may as well go down and guard the door. You
will be able to tell us, at least, if they are up to any mischief.
I should think, however, the fight is pretty well taken out
of them, and that they will resign themselves to their fate
now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is a bad job for me,</q> Forster said, as he and Will sat
down together on a gun.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am awfully sorry, Forster, but I am afraid there is no
getting out of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, that is out of the question.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is one thing, Forster. If you did not put a sentry
over the hatchway, neither did I, so I am just as much to
blame for the disaster as you are. If I had had a man there
they could hardly have cut away the woodwork without his
hearing. I certainly wish you to state in your report that you
took the watch over from me just as I left it, and that no
sentry had been placed there, as ought certainly to have been
done when I came on watch at eight o’clock.</q>
</p>

<pb n='90'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
<q>It is very kind of you, Gilmore, to wish to take the blame
upon your own shoulders, but the responsibility is wholly
mine. I ought to have reminded you to put a man there,
there can be no question at all about that, but I never gave
the matter a thought, and the blunder has cost us nine good
seamen. I shall be lucky if I only escape with a tremendous
wigging. I must bear it as well as I can.</q>
</p>

<p>
While they were talking the sailors were busy splicing the
shrouds. When this was done two of the men swarmed up
the mast by means of the halliards. Then they hoisted up
the shrouds, and fastened them round the mast, making all
taut by means of the lanyards. The sails were still standing,
flapping loosely in the light breeze, so the sheets were hauled
in and the vessel again began to move through the water.
Two days later they anchored in Valetta harbour.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here goes,</q> Forster said, as he stepped into the boat with
his report. <q>It all depends now on what sort of a man the
admiral is, but I should not be surprised if he ordered me to
take court-martial.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I hope not!</q> Will exclaimed. <q>I do wish you would
let me go with you to share the blame.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cannot be thought of,</q> Forster said; <q>the commanding
officer must make the report.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two hours later Forster returned.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is all right, Gilmore,</q> he said as the boat came alongside.
<q rend="post: none">Of course I got a wigging. The admiral read the report

</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>It was a smart trick taking to the shrouds,</q> the admiral

</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>That is what I expected, sir,</q> said I, <q>but they seemed to

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>I suppose your men sold their lives dearly?</q> he asked.</q>

they certainly accounted for more than one man each.</q></q>

</p>

<p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>It will indeed, sir,</q> I said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Then he started to question me about you.</q>

<q rend="post: none"><q>Your junior officer seems to have behaved very well,</q> he

</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>His plan of forming a barricade across the bow so that
his little force were ample to defend it was excellent,</q> he said.
<pb n='92'/><anchor id='Pg092'/><q>Also the blocking up of the door of communication through
the bulkhead was well thought of, and his final escape through
the hatchway and sudden attack upon the enemy was well
carried out. I will make a note of his name. I suppose he
is not as old as yourself, as he is your junior?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>No, sir, he is not yet sixteen, and he was only promoted

</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>Promoted from being a ship’s boy?</q> the admiral said in
surprise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Then I had to give a detailed account, not only of the
fight that led to your promotion, but also of your life so

</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">When I had finished, the admiral said:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q>He must be a singular lad, this Gilmore, and is likely
to prove an honour to the navy. Bring him up here at this
hour to-morrow; I shall be glad to see him. There, now, you
may go, and don’t forget in future that when you are in
charge of prisoners you must always place a guard over
them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So unknowingly you have done me a good turn, Gilmore,
for I expect that if the admiral had not been so interested in
you he would not have let me off so easily. You must put on
your best uniform for the first time and go up to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am afraid I should have felt very shaky if I had
not heard your account of the admiral. From what you say
it is evident he is a kindly man, and after all you have told
him about me he can’t have many questions to ask.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I feel a good deal easier in my mind, as you may
guess,</q> Forster said. <q>When I went ashore I felt like a bad
boy who is in for a flogging. I dare say I shall get it a little
<pb n='93'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>hotter from the captain, but it will be just a wigging, and
there will be no talk of courts-martial. By what we saw of
the goods on board this craft before this rumpus took place
I fancy the Moor had captured and plundered a well-laden
merchantman. In that case the prize-money will be worth a
good round sum, and as the admiral gets a picking out of it
he will be still more inclined to look favourably on the matter.
Here comes the boat to take off the prisoners. I have no
doubt some of them will be hanged, especially as they will
not be able to give any satisfactory explanation as to the fate
of the merchantman. As soon as we have got rid of them we
will overhaul a few of the bales and see what are their contents.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the last of the prisoners were taken ashore Forster
and Gilmore went below and examined the cargo. This
proved to consist of valuable Eastern stuffs, broad-cloths,
silks, and Turkish carpets.
</p>

<p>
<q>It could not be better,</q> Forster said; <q>she must be worth
a lot of money, and it will add to the nice little handful of
prize-money we shall get when we return home. They ought
to give us a good round sum for the <name type="ship">Proserpine</name>; then there
were the three Moorish vessels, though I don’t think they
were worth much, for their holds were nearly empty and I
fancy they had only been cruising a short time. This fellow,
however, is a rich prize; he certainly had very hard luck,
falling in with us as he did. I fancy the ship they pillaged
was a Frenchman or Italian, more likely the latter. I don’t
think there are many French merchantmen about, and it is
most likely that the cargo was intended for Genoa, whence
a good part of it might be sent to Paris. Well, it makes little
<pb n='94'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>difference to us what its destination was, its proceeds are
certainly destined to enrich us instead of its original consignees.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning Will put on his best uniform for the first
time, and, landing with Forster, ascended the Nix Mangare
stairs and called on the admiral.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Mr. Gilmore,</q> the admiral said as he was shown in,
<q>it gives me great pleasure to meet so promising a young
officer. Will you kindly tell me such details of your early
history as may seem fitting to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will gave him a fairly detailed account of his history up to
the time he joined the navy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, you cannot be too grateful to that young lady,
but at the same time there are few who would have availed
themselves so well of her assistance. It is nothing short of
astonishing that you should have progressed so far under her
care that you were able, after a few lessons from the chaplain
of your ship, to use a quadrant. As a mark of my approbation
I will present you with one. I will send it off to your ship
to-morrow morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
With many thanks Will took his leave, and returned with
Forster to the prize.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning the quadrant arrived. That
afternoon the prize was handed over to the prize-agents, and
the crew transferred to the naval barracks, Forster and Gilmore
receiving lodging money to live on shore. Hitherto,
the only fortifications Will had seen were those of Portsmouth,
so he was greatly interested in the castle with its
heavy frowning stone batteries, the deep cut separating it from
the rest of the island, and its towering rock. Then there was
<pb n='95'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>the church of St. John, paved with tombstones of the knights,
and other places of interest. The costume and appearance of
the inhabitants amused and pleased him, as did the shops with
their laces, cameos, and lovely coral ornaments. Beyond the
walls there were the gardens full of orange-trees, bright with
their fruit, and the burying-place of the old monks, each body
standing in a niche, dressed in his gown and cowl as in life.
</p>

<p>
Will wished that he could get his share of prize-money at
once, and promised himself that his very first expenditure
would be a suite of coral for the lady who had done so much
for him. In no way, he thought, could he lay out money
with such gratification to himself.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight later the <name type="ship">Furious</name> came into harbour bringing
another prize with her. This had been taken without any
trouble. One morning, when day broke, she was seen only
a quarter of a mile from the frigate. A gun was at once fired
across her bows, and, seeing that escape was impossible, she
hauled down her colours without resistance.
</p>

<p>
Forster and Gilmore, with the officers who had brought in
the other prizes, all went on board at once and made their
reports. As Forster had predicted, he was severely reprimanded
for not having placed a sentry over the prisoners, but
in consideration of the fact that he had already been spoken
to by the admiral himself the captain was less severe on him
than he would otherwise have been. Gilmore, on the other
hand, was warmly commended.
</p>

<p>
<q>You managed extremely well,</q> the captain said, <q>and
showed that you fully deserved your promotion.</q>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER V</head>

<head type="sub">A PIRATE HOLD</head>

  <p>
The <name type="ship">Furious</name> was at once placed in the hands of the dockyard
people, who set to work immediately to repair
damages, while large quantities of provisions were brought off
from the stores on shore.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are not generally as sharp as this,</q> Forster said; <q>I
should say there must be something in the wind.</q>
</p>

<p>
Such was the general opinion on board the ship, for double
gangs of workers were put on, and in three days she was
reported to be again ready for sea. The captain came on
board half an hour later and spoke to the first lieutenant, and
orders were at once issued to get up the anchors and set
sail. Her head was pointed west as she left the harbour, and
the general opinion was that she was bound for Gibraltar. It
leaked out, however, in the afternoon that she was sailing
under sealed orders, and as that would hardly be the case if
she were bound for Gibraltar, there were innumerable discussions
among the sailors as to her destination. Could she
be meant to cruise along the west coast of France, or to return
to England and join a fleet being got ready there for some
important <anchor id="corr096"/><corr sic="operation.">operation?</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you say, Bill?</q> one of the men asked an old
sailor, who had sat quietly, taking no part in the discussion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you asks me,</q> he said, <q>I should say we are
bound for the West Indies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The West Indies, Bill! What makes you think that?</q>
</p>

<pb n='97'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>

<p>
<q>Well, I thinks that, because it seems to me as that is where
we are most wanted. The French have got a stronger fleet
than we have out there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, they have got as strong a fleet at Toulon, and quite
as strong a one at Brest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that may be so, but I think we are pretty safe to
lick them at either of these places if they will come out and
fight us fair, whereas in the West Indies they are a good bit
stronger. There are so <anchor id="corr097"/><corr sic="may">many</corr> ports and islands that, as we are,
so to speak, a good deal scattered, they might at any moment
come upon us in double our strength.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you ever been there before, Bill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ay, two or three times. In some respects it could not be
better; you can buy fruit, and ’bacca and rum for next to
nothing, when your officers give you a chance. Lor’, the games
them niggers are up to to circumvent them would make you
laugh! When you land, an old black woman will come up with
a basket full of cocoa-nuts. Your officer steps up to her and
examines them, and they look as right as can be. Perhaps he
breaks one and it is full of milk; very good. So you go up
to buy, and the officer looks on. The woman hands you two
or three, and when she gives you the last one she winks her
eye. She don’t say anything, but you drop a sixpence into
her hand among the coppers you have to pay for the others,
and when she has quite sold out the officer orders you into
the boat to lie off till he comes back. And when he returns
he is quite astonished to find that most of the crew are three
sheets in the wind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then they will bring you sugar-canes half as thick as your
wrist, looking as innocent as may be; both ends are sealed
<pb n='98'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>up with bits of the pith, and when you open one end you
find that all the joints have been bored through, and the cane
is full of rum. But mind, lads, you are fools if you touch it;
it is new and strong and rank, and a bottle of it would knock
you silly. And that is not the worst of it, for fever catches
hold of you, and fever out there ain’t no joke. You eats a
good dinner at twelve o’clock, and you are buried in the
palisades at six; that’s called yellow jack. It is a country
where you can enjoy yourselves reasonable with fruit, and
perhaps a small sup of rum, but where you must beware of
drinking; if you do that you are all right. The islands are
beautiful, downright beautiful; there ain’t many places which
I troubles myself to look at, but the West Indies are like
gardens with feathery sorts of trees, and mountains, and
everything that you can want in nature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is very hot, isn’t it, Bill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">It ain’t, so to speak, cool in summer-time. In winter it is
just right, but in summer you would like to lie naked all day
and have cold water poured over you. Still, one gets accustomed
to it in time. Then, you see, there is always excitement
of some kind. There are pirates and Frenchmen, and there are
Spaniards, whom I regard as a cross between the other two.
They hide about among the islands and pop out when you
least expect them. You always have to keep your eyes in
your head and your cutlass handy when you go ashore. The
worst of them are what they call mulattoes; they are a whity-brown
sort of chaps, neither one thing nor the other, and a
nice cut-throat lot they are. A sailor who drinks too much
and loses his boat is as like as not to be murdered by some
of them before morning. I hate them chaps like poison.
<pb n='99'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>There are scores of small craft manned by them which prey
upon the negroes, who are an honest, merry lot, and not bad
sailors either in their way. Sometimes four or five of these
pirate craft will go together, and many of them are a good size
and carry a lot of guns. They make some island their head-quarters.
Any niggers there may be on it they turn into
slaves. There are thousands of these islands, so at least I
should say, scattered about, some of them mere sand-spots,
others a goodish size.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I hope it is the West Indies. There is plenty of
amusement and plenty of fighting to be done there, and I
should like to know what a sailor can want more.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a hum of approval; the picture was certainly
tempting.
</p>

<p>
After a six days’ run with a favourable wind they passed
through the Straits without touching at Gibraltar, and held
west for twenty-four hours. Then the sealed orders were
opened, and it was soon known throughout the ship that it
was indeed the West Indies for which they were bound. The
ship’s course was at once changed. Teneriffe was passed,
and they stopped for a day to take in fresh water and vegetables
at St. Vincent. Then her head was turned more westward,
and three weeks later the <name type="ship">Furious</name> anchored at Port
Royal. The captain went on shore at once to visit the admiral,
and returned with the news that the <name type="ship">Furious</name> was to cruise off
the coast of Cuba. The exact position of the French fleet
was unknown, but when last heard of was in the neighbourhood
of that island.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must keep a sharp look-out for them,</q> the captain said,
<q>and bring back news of their whereabouts if I do catch
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>sight of them; that is, of course, if we don’t catch a tartar, for
not only do the French ships carry heavier guns than we do,
but they sail faster. We are as speedy, however, as any of our
class, and will, I hope, be able to show them a clean pair of
heels. In addition to this, I am told that three piratical craft,
which have their rendezvous on some island off the south
coast of Cuba, have been committing great depredations. A
number of merchantmen have been missed; so I am to keep
a sharp look-out for them and to clip their wings if I can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What size are they?</q> asked the first lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
<q>One is said to be a cutter carrying eight guns and a
long-tom, the other two are schooners, each carrying six guns
on a broadside; it is not known whether they have a long-tom,
but the probability is that they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They would be rather formidable opponents then if we
caught them together, as they carry as many guns as we do,
and those long-toms are vastly more powerful than anything
we have. I think it is a pity that they don’t furnish all ships
on this station with a long twenty-four; it would be worth
nearly all our broadsides.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, Mr. Farrance, but somehow the people at home
cannot get out of their regular groove, and fill up the ships with
eight and ten-pounders, while, as you say, one long twenty-four
would be worth a dozen of them. If we do catch one of
these pirates I shall confiscate their long guns to our own use.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be a capital plan, sir. Well, I am glad we shall
have something to look for besides the French fleet, which
may be a hundred miles away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ay, or a thousand,</q> the captain added.
</p>

<p>
Will had been standing not far from the captain, and heard
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>this conversation. His heart beat high at the thought of the
possibility of a fight with these murderous pirates.
</p>

<p>
For three weeks they cruised off the coast of Cuba. They
saw no sign whatever of the French fleet, but from time to
time they heard from native craft of the pirates. The
natives differed somewhat widely as to the head-quarters of
these pests, but all agreed that it was on an island lying in
the middle of dangerous shoals.
</p>

<p>
One day they saw smoke rising some fifteen miles away
and at once shaped their course for it. When they approached
it they found that it rose from a vessel enveloped in flames.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a European ship,</q> the captain said as they neared
her. <q>Send an officer in a boat to row round her and gather
any particulars as to her fate. I see no boats near her, and
I am afraid that it is the work of those pirates.</q>
</p>

<p>
All watched the boat with intent interest as she rowed
round the ship.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no doubt whatever that it is the work of pirates,</q>
the officer said on his return. <q>Her bulwarks are burnt
away, and I could make out several piles on deck which looked
like dead men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Send a man up to the mast-head, Farrance, and tell him
to scan the horizon carefully for a sail. I should say this
ship can’t have been burning above three hours at most.</q>
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the man reached the top of the mast than he
called down <q>Sail ho!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where away?</q> Mr. Farrance shouted.
</p>

<p>
<q>On the port bow, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you make her out to be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should say she was a schooner by her topsails.</q>
</p>

<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>

<p>
The ship’s course was at once changed, and every rag of sail
put upon her. The first lieutenant climbed to the upper crosstrees,
and after a long look through his telescope returned to
deck.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should say she is certainly one of the schooners that we
are in search of, sir, but I doubt whether with this light wind
we have much chance of overhauling her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will try anyhow,</q> the captain said. <q>She is probably
steering for the rendezvous, so by following her we may at
least get some important information.</q>
</p>

<p>
All day the chase continued, but there was no apparent
change in the position of the two vessels. The <name type="ship">Furious</name> was
kept on the same course through the night, and to the satisfaction
of all on board they found, when morning broke, that
they had certainly gained on the schooner, as her mainsails
were now visible. At twelve o’clock a low bank of sand was
sighted ahead, and the schooner had entered a channel in this
two hours later. The <name type="ship">Furious</name> had to be hove-to outside the
shoal. The sand extended a long distance, but there were
several breaks in it, and from the masthead a net-work of
channels could be made out. It was a great disappointment
to the crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> to have to give up the chase and
see the schooner only some four miles off on her way under
easy sail.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is an awkward place, Mr. Farrance,</q> the captain said,
<q>and will need a deal of examination before we go any farther.
The first thing to do will be to sail round and note and sound
the various channels. I wish you would go aloft with your
glass and see whether there is any ground higher than the rest.
Such a place would naturally be the point of rendezvous.</q>
</p>

<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>

<p>
Lieutenant Farrance went aloft and presently returned.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a clump of green trees,</q> he said, <q>some ten miles
off. The schooner is nearing them, and I think, though of
this I am not certain, that I can make out the masts of another
craft lying there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it is something to have located her,</q> the captain
said. <q>Now we must find how we can best get there; that
will be a work of time. We may as well begin by examining
some of these channels.</q>
</p>

<p>
Four boats were at once lowered and rowed to the mouths
of those nearest. The sounding operations quickly showed
that in three of them there was but two feet of water; the
other was somewhat deeper, but there was still two feet less
water than the <name type="ship">Furious</name> drew. The deep part was very narrow
and winding.
</p>

<p>
<q>It may be this one that the schooner has gone up,</q> the
captain said. <q>I have no doubt she draws three or four feet
less than we do, and, knowing the passage perfectly, she could
get up it easily. I hope, however, we shall find something
deeper presently.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next three days were spent in circumnavigating the
sand-banks and in sounding the various channels, but at last
the captain was obliged to admit that none of them were deep
enough for the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, although there were fully half a dozen
by which vessels of lighter draught might enter.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am ready to run any fair risk, Mr. Farrance,</q> he said,
<q>but I daren’t send a boat expedition against such a force as
that, especially as they have no doubt thrown up batteries to
strengthen their position. They must have any number of
cannon which they have taken from ships they have captured.</q>
</p>

<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>

<p>
<q>It would certainly be a desperate enterprise,</q> the first
lieutenant agreed, <q>and, as you say, too dangerous to be
attempted now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gilmore,</q> Forster said, as the midshipmen met at dinner,
<q>you are always full of ideas; can’t you suggest any way by
which we might get at them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid not,</q> Will laughed. <q>The only possible way
that I can see would be to sail away, get together a number of
native craft, and then make a dash at the place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would be the advantage of native craft over our
boats,</q> one of the others said scoffingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>The great advantage would be that, if we had a dozen
native craft, the men would be scattered about their decks
instead of being crowded in boats, and would therefore be
able to land with comparatively little loss.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word,</q> one of the seniors said, <q>I think there is
something in Gilmore’s idea. Of course they would have to
be very shallow, and one would have to choose a night when
there was just enough breeze to take them quietly along. At
any rate I will run the risk of being snubbed, and will mention
it to one of the lieutenants. ’Pon my word, the more I
think of it the more feasible does it seem.</q>
</p>

<p>
After dinner was over the midshipman went up to Mr.
Peters, who was now third lieutenant, and saluted.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q> the lieutenant asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, it is an idea of Gilmore’s. It may not be worth
anything at all, but it certainly seemed to me that there was
something in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His ideas are generally worth something. What is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
The midshipman explained Will’s plan.
</p>

<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>

<p>
<q>There is certainly something in it,</q> Peters said. <q>What
a beggar that boy is for ideas! At any rate, I will mention it
to Mr. Farrance.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Farrance at first pooh-poohed the idea, but, on thinking
it over, he concluded that it would be as well at any rate to
lay it before the captain.
</p>

<p>
<q>’Pon my word it does seem feasible,</q> the captain said.
<q>They could tow the boats in after them, so that, when they
came under the pirates’ fire, the men could get into the boats
and so be in shelter. Only one hand would be required to
steer each vessel, and the rest would remain out of sight
of the enemy until near enough to make a dash either for
the shore or the pirates’ craft, as the case might be. It is
a good idea, a really brilliant idea, and well worth putting
into effect. Besides, each of the vessels could carry one or two
small guns, and so keep down the enemy’s fire to some extent.
Send for Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Will entered the captain’s cabin cap in
hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Farrance tells me, Mr. Gilmore, that you have an idea
that by collecting a number of native craft of shallow draught
we might attack the pirates with some hope of success.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was only an idea, sir, that occurred to me on the spur
of the moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am inclined to regard it as a feasible one,</q> the
captain said. <q>A dozen boats of that kind would carry the
greater part of the ship’s crew, and if each had a couple of
light cannon on board they would be able to answer the
enemy’s fire. If I do attack in this manner I propose to send
the boats in towing behind the native craft, so that when the
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>enemy’s fire becomes really heavy the men can take their
places in these, and so be in shelter until close enough to
make a dash. Is there any other suggestion you can offer I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. The plan of taking the boats certainly seems to
me to be a good one.</q>
</p>

<p>
The captain smiled a little. He was not accustomed to have
his plans approved of by midshipmen. However, he only
said: <q>I think it will work. Should any other suggestion
occur to you, you will mention it to Mr. Farrance. I am really
obliged to you for the idea, which does great credit to your
sharpness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir!</q> said Will, and retired.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the frigate was sailing away from the sand-banks.
</p>

<p>
<q>What did the old man say?</q> the midshipmen asked Will
as he rejoined them.
</p>

<p>
<q>He thinks that there was something in the idea, but of
course he has greatly improved it. He means to send the
boats towing behind the native craft, so that if the fire gets
very heavy the men can take to them and be towed in perfect
shelter until near enough to make a rush. He intends to put
a gun or two in each of the native boats, to keep down the
enemy’s fire a bit as they approach.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is an improvement,</q> Forster said, <q>and it certainly
seems, Gilmore, as if you had found a way out of our dilemma.</q>
</p>

<p>
Those who had been most disposed to laugh at Will’s suggestion
were eager to congratulate him now that the captain
had expressed his approval of it and had adopted it.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Furious</name> sailed direct for Port Royal. There was no
fear that the pirates would abandon their island, for they
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>would naturally take the retirement of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> as an
admission of defeat. They were, of course, open to a boat
attack, but they would consider themselves strong enough to
beat off any such attempt without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at Port Royal, Lieutenant Farrance went ashore
in search of suitable craft. He had no difficulty in buying a
dozen old native boats. He then procured a large quantity of
cane, and lashed these in the bottom of the boats, using a sufficient
quantity to keep them afloat even if they were riddled
with balls. Then the carpenters set to work to make platforms
in the bows of each to carry a seven-pounder gun. In three
days the work was completed and the <name type="ship">Furious</name> started again,
putting two men in each of the boats and taking them in tow.
</p>

<p>
Five days later they arrived off the sand-spits, and preparations
were at once made for the attack. Lying low in the
water, and keeping in a line behind the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, the native
craft would be altogether invisible from the central islands,
so that the pirates would not be aware of the method of
attack. The greater portion of the men were told off to them,
only forty remaining on board the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. All was ready
an hour after nightfall, and the men took their places in the
native craft, fastening their boats to the stern in each case.
The sails were at once got up, and, following each other in
single file, they entered the channel which had been found to
be the deepest. The leading boat kept on sounding—an easy
matter, as, the wind being light, the rate of progress did not
exceed a mile an hour.
</p>

<p>
Will had been posted by the first lieutenant in his own
boat, which was the leader, and Dimchurch and Tom Stevens
were among the crew. Dimchurch had exchanged places with
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>another seaman; Tom had been allowed a place by the special
solicitation of Will.
</p>

<p>
<q>He fought stoutly in that fight on the Moorish prize, and
he is very much attached to me. I should be obliged, sir, if
you would take him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right!</q> said the first lieutenant; <q>let him stow himself
away in the bow till the fighting begins.</q> Accordingly Tom
curled himself up by the gun.
</p>

<p>
It was between two and three in the morning when the
trees of the central island were made out; they were not
more than five hundred yards away. Presently from a projecting
point, where a heavy mass could be made out, a cannon
was fired. The shot flew overhead, but the effect was instantaneous.
Shouts were heard on shore and the sound of oars
in rowlocks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take to the boats!</q> the lieutenant shouted. The two
lines of lights in the port-holes showed the positions of two
vessels, and the men on the native craft left to work the guns
at once opened fire at them. For a minute or two there was
no return, and it was evident that the greater portion of the
crew had been ashore. The battery that had first fired now
kept up a steady discharge, but as the boats were almost invisible,
the shot flew wildly overhead or splashed harmlessly in
the water. The gunners on board disregarded it, and maintained
a steady fire at the ports of the enemy’s vessels. From
these now came answering flashes, but the shot did little
damage.
</p>

<p>
When the attacking party had got within a hundred yards
of the pirate ships, the lieutenant gave the signal, and the
boats, with a cheer, dashed forward at full speed. They had
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
received instructions how to act in case two vessels were found,
and, dividing, they made for their respective quarters.
</p>

<p>
The race was short and sharp, each officer urging his men
to the fullest exertions. The instant they were alongside the
oars were cast aside, and the men, drawing their cutlasses,
leapt to their feet and endeavoured to climb up. They were
thrust back with boarding-pikes, axes, and weapons of all
kinds, but at last managed to get a foothold aft.
</p>

<p>
Will in vain endeavoured to get on deck; the sides were too
high for him. Finding himself left with half the crew, he
made his way in the boat forward along the side of the pirate
vessel and clambered up by the bowsprit shrouds. Some of
the men in the other boats, seeing what he was doing, followed
his example. They were unnoticed. A fierce fight was raging
on the quarter-deck, and the shouting was prodigious. When
some thirty men were gathered Will led the way aft. Their
arrival was opportune, for the attacking party, under the
lieutenant, had been vastly outnumbered by the pirates, and
although fighting stoutly, had been penned against the bulwark,
where with difficulty they defended themselves.
</p>

      </figure></p>
  </else></pgIf>
<p>
With a cheer Will’s party rushed aft, taking the pirates in
the rear. Many of these were cut down, and the rest fell
back confused by this unexpected attack.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now is your time, lads!</q> the lieutenant shouted. <q>Throw
yourselves upon them and drive them back!</q>
</p>

<p>
Although the pirates still fought desperately, knowing that
no mercy would be extended them, the steady valour of the
sailors was too much for them. At last the pirate captain
was cut down by Dimchurch, and with his fall his men entirely
lost heart. Some threw down their arms, and many of them
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>jumped overboard and swam ashore. A loud cheer burst from
the sailors as the resistance came to an end.
</p>

<p>
The fight was still raging on board the other ship, and the
lieutenant ordered the men of his own and another boat to
row to it. Unseen by the pirates they reached the bow and
climbed on deck. Then as soon as all had gained a footing
they rushed aft. Here, too, the rear attack decided the
struggle; in five minutes all was over.
</p>

<p>
Daylight was now breaking, and they were able to see that
there was a line of storehouses on the islands together with a
large number of huts. The greater portion of the men were
ordered to land, and the fugitives from the ships were hunted
down. Most of these had taken refuge in the battery at the
mouth of the harbour, but as this was open on the land side it
was soon stormed and the defenders all cut down. Then the
huts were searched and burnt and the storehouses opened.
</p>

<p>
These were found to contain an enormous quantity of goods,
the spoil evidently of many ships, and the men were at once
set to work to transfer it to the prizes, and when these were
full, to the native craft. A boat had been sent off, directly the
fighting was over, with news to the captain of the success they
had gained, and in the morning another message was sent saying
that it would take four or five days to transfer the stores
to the ships, and the <name type="ship">Furious</name> had in consequence hoisted anchor
and gone for a short cruise away from the dangerous proximity
of the sands.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the third day a large cutter was seen
approaching. Lieutenant Farrance ordered the native craft to
be towed behind a small islet, where they were hidden from
sight of a vessel entering the harbour, and the crews to take
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>their places on the captured vessels. When this was done
the guns were loaded and the men stood to their quarters.
The new-comer approached without apparently entertaining
any suspicion that anything unusual had happened, the huts
that had been destroyed being hidden by the groves of trees.
</p>

<p>
As she came abreast of them the guns were run out and the
lieutenant shouted: <q>I call upon you to surrender! These
vessels are prizes of His Majesty’s frigate <name type="ship">Furious</name>, and if you
don’t surrender we will sink you at once!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a hoarse shout of fury and astonishment, and
then the captain called back: <q>We will never surrender!</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the schooners at once poured in their broadsides,
doing immense damage, and killing large numbers of the
pirates. A few cannon were fired in answer, but in such haste
that they had no effect. When two more broadsides had been
fired into her, the cutter blew up with a tremendous explosion
which shook both vessels to the keel and threw many of the
men down. When the smoke cleared away the cutter had disappeared.
Whether a shot had reached her magazine, or
whether she was blown up by her desperate commander, was
never known, as not a single survivor of the crew was picked
up.
</p>

<p>
When the work of loading was completed, and the storehouses
had been destroyed by fire, the two schooners sailed
out, followed by the native craft with the boats towing behind.
</p>

<p>
The victory had been won at very little cost. Only three
men had been killed and some seventeen wounded, while with
the exception of some thirty prisoners, for the most part
wounded, the whole pirate force had been annihilated.
</p>

<p>
The captain had already visited the scene, having rowed in
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>as soon as he had received news of the success of the expedition.
In Lieutenant Farrance’s despatch several officers
were noted for distinguished conduct. Among these was
Will Gilmore, to whom the lieutenant gave great credit for
the manner in which he had boarded the pirate, and by his
sudden attack upon the rear of the enemy converted what
was a distinctly perilous situation into a success.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you what it is, Gilmore,</q> one of the midshipmen
jestingly said, <q>if you go on like this we shall send you to
Coventry. It is unbearable that you should always get to the
front.</q>
</p>

<p>
Great was the rejoicing among the merchants of Port Royal
when the <name type="ship">Furious</name> returned with her two prizes and it became
known that the third had been destroyed and the nest of
pirates completely broken up.
</p>

<p>
On the following day Will was sent for by the admiral.
</p>

<p>
<q>My lad,</q> he said, <q>I wish to tell you that although it is
not usual for a captain to acknowledge in official despatches
that he acted on the ideas of a young midshipman, Captain
Marker has done full justice to you in his verbal report to
me. Your idea showed great ingenuity, and although the
surprise was so complete that even had the attack been made
by ships’ boats only it would probably have been successful,
this detracts in no way from the merit of the suggestion. Of
course you have some years to serve yet before you can pass,
but I can promise you that as soon as you do so you shall,
if you are still here, have your appointment at once as mate,
with employment in which you can distinguish <corr sic="no quote">yourself.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much, sir!</q> Will said, and, saluting, retired.
</p>

<p>
In three days the ship’s prizes and native craft were
un<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>loaded, and their contents were found to be of very great
value, for by the marks upon the goods it was evident that at
least twenty-three merchantmen must have been captured and
pillaged, and as none of these were ever heard of after they
had sailed it was reasonably concluded that all must have
been burnt, and those on board murdered. The case was so
atrocious that the prisoners were all tried, condemned to death,
and executed in batches. There was little doubt that the
pirates must have had agents in the various ports who had
kept them informed of the sailing of ships, but there was no
means of ascertaining who these parties were.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Furious</name> sailed four days after her return, and this time
cruised on the northern coast of Cuba. One day, when sailing
along by a stretch of high cliffs, a ship of war suddenly appeared
from a narrow inlet; she was followed by two others.
The <name type="ship">Furious</name> was headed round at once, and with the three
French frigates in pursuit started on her way back. The
wind was light, and though every stitch of canvas was set, it
was evident, after an hour’s sailing, that one, at least, of her
pursuers gained steadily on her. The French ship would,
indeed, have gained more than she had done had she not
yawed occasionally and fired with her bow-chasers. The
<name type="ship">Furious</name> had shifted two of her broadside guns to her stern
to reply, but, although the aim was good, only one or two
hits were made, the distance being still too great for accurate
shooting.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish the other two Frenchmen were a little slower,</q>
the captain said to the first lieutenant. <q>They are only a
little farther behind her than when we started, and are, I
think, only about half a mile astern of her. If she continues
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>to travel at her present rate she will be close up to us by
sunset. She is just about our own size, and I make no doubt
that we should give a good account of her, but we could not
hope to do so before her two consorts came up, and we could
not expect to beat all three. If we could but fall in with one
of our cruisers I would fight them willingly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the odds are too much against us at present, sir.
I don’t say that we could not fight them separately, but we
could hardly hope to beat three of them at once. We can’t
make her go through the water faster than she is doing as far
as I can see.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, every sail seems to be doing its best. There is
nothing for it but to pray either for another frigate or for
more wind. I am not sure that wind would help us, still it
might.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think, sir,</q> the lieutenant said, two hours later, <q>that
one of your wishes is going to be fulfilled. There is a cloud
rising very rapidly on the larboard bow, and from its colour
and appearance it seems to me that we are going to have
a tornado.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be welcome indeed,</q> the captain said. <q>We have
been hit ten times in the last half-hour, and the nearest ship
is not more than three-quarters of a mile away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later the captain said: <q>It is certainly a
tornado. All hands reduce sail. Don’t waste a moment, lads;
it will be on us in three minutes.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a moment the vessel was a scene of bustle; the men
swarmed up the rigging, urged to the greatest exertions not
only by the voices of their officers but by the appearance of
the heavens. The frigate behind held on three or four minutes
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>longer, then her sheets were let fly, and immediately she was
a scene of wild confusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be on her before she is ready,</q> the captain said
grimly, <q>and if it is, she will turn turtle. It is as much as we
shall do to be ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
Just as a line of white foam was seen approaching with the
speed of a race-horse, the last man reached the deck.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would give a great deal,</q> the captain said, <q>to have
time to get down all our light spars. Get ready your small
fore try-sail, and a small stay-sail to run up on the mizzen.</q>
</p>

<p>
A minute later the storm was upon them. A blinding
sheet of spray, driven with almost the force of grape-shot,
swept over the ship, followed by a deafening roar and a force
of wind that seemed about to lift the ship bodily out of the
water. Over and over she heeled, and all thought that she
was about to founder, when, even above the noise of the
storm, three loud crashes were heard, and the three masts,
with all their lofty hamper, went over the side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God,</q> the lieutenant exclaimed, <q>that has saved
her!</q>
</p>

<p>
All hands with axes and knives began cutting away the
wreckage. At the same time the two try-sails were hoisted,
but they at once blew out of the bolt-ropes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t you think, sir,</q> the first lieutenant shouted, <q>that
if we lash a hawser to all this hamper, and hang to it, it will act
as a floating anchor, and bring her head up to the wind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well thought of, Mr. Farrance,</q> the captain shouted
back; <q>by all means do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
The order was given and immediately carried out. The
tangle of ropes and spars, with the ship’s strongest hawser
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>attached, soon drifted past her, and as the cable tightened the
vessel’s head began to come slowly up into the wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>That will delay her fate for a bit,</q> the captain said, <q>but
we can’t hope that it will more than delay it, unless we can
get up some sail and crawl off the coast. Get ready the
strongest try-sails we have in case they may be wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the sails were got ready, but for the
present there was nothing for it but to hang on to the wreckage.
The shore was some miles away, but in spite of the floating
anchor the drift was great. The crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> had now
time to breathe, but it was pitch dark and nothing could be
seen save the white heads of the waves which now every
moment threatened to overwhelm them. Not a trace of the
frigate which had so hotly pursued them could be seen.
</p>

<p>
<q>God rest their souls!</q> the captain said earnestly. <q>I am
afraid she is gone. In fair fight one strives to do as much
damage as possible, but such a catastrophe as this is awful. I
trust the other two took warning in time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope so too. They were under the lee of that island we
passed shortly before it began, so would be partially sheltered.
There is no hope for the first, and their fate is terrible indeed,
sir; all the more awful, perhaps, because we know that it may
become ours before long.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no doubt about that,</q> the captain said. <q>Unless
the wind drops or chops round our fate is sealed, and a few
hours will see the ship grinding her bones on that rocky shore.
It is too dark to see it, but we know that we are most surely
approaching it.</q>
</p>

<p>
As day broke the shore was made out a little more than
half a mile away. The captain then called the crew together.
</p>

<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>

<p>
<q>My lads,</q> he shouted, but in spite of his efforts his voice
was heard but a few yards away, <q>everything has been done
for the ship that could be done, but as you see for yourselves
our efforts have been in vain. I trust that you will all get
ashore, but as far as we can see at present the rocks are almost
precipitous, and, high as they are, the spray flies right over
them. I thank you all for your good conduct while the ship
has been in commission, and am sure that you will know how
to die, and will preserve your calm and courage till the end.
Go to your stations and remain there until she is about to
strike; then each man must make the best fight for life that
he can.</q>
</p>

<p>
The men went quietly off. Mr. Farrance stood watching
the shore with his telescope. Presently he exclaimed: <q>See,
sir, there is a break in the cliff! I do not know how far it
goes in, but it looks to me as if it might be the opening to an
inlet. We are nearly opposite to it, so if we shift the hawser
from the bow to the stern she will swing round, and will
probably drift right into the creek if that is what it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means let us make the attempt,</q> the captain said.
<q>Thank God, there is a hope of escape for us all!</q>
</p>

<p>
The men sprang to their feet with alacrity when they heard
the news. Another hawser was brought up and firmly spliced
to the one in use just beyond the bulwark forward. Then it
was led along outside the shrouds and fastened to the bitts
astern and then to the mizzen-mast. This done, the first
hawser was cut at the bulwark forward, and the ship swung
round almost instantly. As soon as she headed dead for shore
the raffle that had so long served for their floating anchor was
cut adrift and the try-sail was hoisted on the stump of the
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>foremast, and with six good men at the wheel the vessel
surged shorewards under the force of the gale, every man on
board holding his breath. The opening was but a ship’s-length
across, but driven by the wind and steered with the greatest
care the <name type="ship">Furious</name> shot into it as quickly and as surely as if
she were propelled with oars. A great shout of relief burst
from the whole crew when, after proceeding for a hundred
yards along a narrow channel, the passage suddenly widened
out into a pool a quarter of a mile across.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let go the anchor!</q> the captain cried, and he had scarce
spoken when the great anchor went thundering down. <q>Pay
out the chain gradually,</q> was the next order, <q>and check her
when she gets half-way across.</q> The order was obeyed and
the vessel’s head swung round, and in less than a minute she
was riding quietly over great waves that came rolling in
through the entrance and broke in foam against the shore of
the inlet. The quiet after the roar and din was almost
startling. Above, the clouds could be seen flying past in
rugged masses, but the breast of the pool, sheltered as it was
from the wind by its lofty sides, was scarcely rippled, and the
waves rolled in as if they were made of glass. Not a word
was heard until the captain spoke.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is the least we can do, men, to thank God for this
miraculous escape. I trust that there is not a man on board
this ship who will not offer his fervent thanks to Him who
has so wonderfully brought us out of the jaws of death.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every head was bared, and for two or three minutes no
sound was heard on board the ship. Then the captain replaced
his hat, and the men went quietly off to their duties.

<head>CHAPTER VI</head>

<head type="sub">A NARROW ESCAPE</head>

<p>
They were hardly anchored before the gale showed signs
of breaking, and in a few hours the sun shone out and
the wind subsided. The destruction of the timber on the
hillsides had been prodigious, and large spaces were entirely
cleared.
</p>

<p>
The captain and first lieutenant had an anxious consultation.
Every boat had gone, and all the masts and rigging.
They were in what was practically a hostile country, for
although Spain had not declared war against us, she gave
every assistance to the French and left her ports open to them.
In a few weeks probably she would openly throw herself into
the scale against us.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is clear that we must communicate with Port Royal
somehow,</q> the captain said, <q>but it certainly isn’t clear how
we are to do it. Between this and the nearest port there may
be miles and miles of mountain all encumbered by fallen trees,
which it would be almost impossible to get through. Then
again we have heard that there are always bands of fugitive
slaves in the mountains, who would be sure to attack us. As
to the sea, we might possibly make shift to build a boat.
There is certainly no lack of timber lying round, and we have
plenty of sail-cloth for sails, so we could fit her out fairly
well. It would be a journey of fully a thousand miles, but
that seems the most feasible plan. A small craft of, say, forty
feet long might be built and got ready for sea in the course
of a week.</q>
</p>

<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>

<p>
<q>I should say so certainly, sir. With the amount of labour
we have at our disposal it might be built even sooner than
that. We have plenty of handy men on board who could give
efficient help to the carpenter’s gang.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose you would build it rather as a ship than as a
boat?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I think so. We could build her of one-and-a-half-inch
planks, fill the seams well with oakum, and give her a
couple of coats of paint. Let her be of shallow draft with
plenty of beam. She should, of course, be decked over, as she
might meet with another tornado. The crew would consist
of an officer and ten men. With such a vessel there should
be no difficulty in reaching Port Royal.</q>
</p>

<p>
The carpenters were at once told off to carry out the
work.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can have as many hands to help you as you wish,</q>
the captain said to the head of the gang. <q>What will you
do first?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall get some planks from below, sir, and make a raft.
By means of that we can get on shore and choose the trunks
that would be most suitable for the purpose; we are sure to
find plenty about. Then we will find a suitable spot for a
ship-yard, and at once start on the work. I will set a gang of
men with axes to square the trunks and make them ready for
sawing. They need not be more than six inches square when
finished, and as I have a couple of double-handed saws we can
soon rip these into planks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How long do you think you will be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should say, sir, with the help I can get, I ought to be
ready to start in less than a week. Of course the ribs will
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>take some time to prepare, but when I have them and the keel
and stem- and stern-post in place the planking will not take us
very long.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is to be decked, Thompson.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All over, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I think so. She may meet with weather like that
we have just come through, and if she is well decked we may
feel assured that she will reach Port Royal. I will leave Mr.
Farrance and you to draw out her lines.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think,</q> said the first lieutenant, <q>she should be like a
magnified launch, with greater beam and a larger draft of
water, which could, perhaps, best be gained by giving her a
deep keel. Of course she must be a good deal higher out of
the water than a launch, say a good four feet under the deck.
There should be no need to carry much ballast; she will gain
her stability by her beam.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, sir. The first thing to be done is to form
the raft.</q>
</p>

<p>
The ship’s crew were soon at work, and it was not long
before a raft was constructed. A rope was at once taken
ashore and made fast to a tree, so that the raft could be hauled
rapidly backwards and forwards between the ship and the
shore.
</p>

<p>
The carpenter and his mates were the first to land, and
while the chief selected a suitable point for a yard his assistants
scattered, examining all fallen trees and cutting the
branches off those that seemed most suitable. These were
soon dragged down to the yard. Then strong gangs set to
work to square them, and the carpenters to cut them into
planks.
</p>

<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>

<p>
The first lieutenant remained with them, encouraging them
at their work, while the junior officers and midshipmen were
divided among the various gangs. By six o’clock, when the
<name type="ship">Furious</name> signalled for all hands to come on board, they had
indeed done a good day’s work. A pile of planks lay ready
to be used as required. The carpenters had made some progress
with a keel, which they were laboriously chopping out
from the straight trunk of a large tree. By evening of the
next day this was finished and placed in position. On the
third day some started to shape the stem- and stern-posts,
while the head-carpenter made from some thin planks
templates of the ribs, and set others to chop out the ribs
to fit.
</p>

<p>
In two more days all was ready for fastening on the planks.
A hundred and fifty men can get through an amazing amount
of labour when they work well and heartily. The planks
were bent by main strength to fit in their places, and as there
was an abundance of nails and other necessary articles on
board, the sheathing was finished in two days. The rest of the
work was comparatively easy. While the deck was being laid
the hull was caulked and painted, and the two masts, sails,
and rigging prepared. The boat had no bulwarks, it being
considered that she would be a much better sea-boat without
them, as in case of shipping a sea the water would run off at
once. The hatchways fore and aft were made very small,
with close-fitting hatches covered with tarpaulin.
</p>

<p>
The captain was delighted when she was finished.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is really a fine boat,</q> he said, <q>with her forty feet of
length and fifteen of beam. It has taken longer to build her
than I had expected, but we had not reckoned sufficiently on
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>the difficulties. Everything, however, has now been done to
make her seaworthy, so those of us who remain here may feel
sure that she will reach Port Royal safely. In case of a gale
the sails must be lowered and lashed to the deck, and all
hands must go below and fasten the hatchways securely. She
has no ballast except her stores, but I think she will be perfectly
safe; there is very little chance of her capsizing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With such beam and such a depth of keel,</q> said the
first lieutenant, <q>she could not possibly capsize. In case of a
tornado the masts might very well be taken out of her and
used as a floating anchor to keep her head to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now whom do you intend to send in her, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will send two officers,</q> the captain said. <q>Peters, and
a midshipman to take his place in case he should be disabled.
I think it is Robson’s turn for special service.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning the boat started soon after daybreak, the
ship’s crew all watching her till the two white lug-sails disappeared
through the opening.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now we will take a strong party of wood-cutters,</q> the
captain said, <q>and see if we can make a way to the top of the
hill and get some idea of the country round. I don’t expect
we shall see much of interest, but it is just as well that we
should be kept employed. By the way, before we do that, we
will get hawsers to the shore and work the frigate round so as
to bring her broadside to bear upon the opening; we ought to
have done that at first. The French may know of this place,
or if they don’t they may learn of it from the Spaniards.
Those two ships astern of us probably got themselves snug
before the tornado struck them, and weathered it all right,
though I doubt very much if they did so, unless they knew
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>of some inlets they could run for. If they did escape, it
is likely that they will be taking some trouble to find out
what became of us. They may have seen their companion’s
fate, but they would hardly have made us out in the darkness.
Still, they would certainly want to report our loss, and may
sail along close inshore to look for timbers and other signs
of wreck. I think, therefore, that it will be advisable to
station a well-armed boat at this end of the cut, and tell them
to row every half-hour or so to the other end and see if they
can make out either sailing or rowing craft coming along the
shore. If they do see them they must retire to this end of
the opening, unless they can find some place where they could
hide till a boat came abreast of them, and then pounce out and
capture it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would certainly be a good precaution, sir. I will see
to it at once—but we are both forgetting that we have no
boats.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bless me, I did forget that altogether! Well, here is that
little dug-out the carpenters made for sending messages to and
from the ship. It will carry three. I should be glad if you
would take a couple of hands and row down to the mouth of
the entrance and see if there is any place where, without any
great difficulty, a small party with a gun could be stationed
so as not to be noticed by a boat coming up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant started at once, and when he returned, some
hours later, he reported that there was a ledge some twenty
feet long and twelve deep. <q>It is about eight feet from the
water’s edge and some twelve above it, sir,</q> he said, <q>and is
not noticeable until one is almost directly opposite it. If we
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>were to pile up rocks regularly four feet high along the face,
both the gun and its crew would be completely hidden.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Get one of the hands on board, Mr. Farrance; I will myself
go and see it with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
One of the men at once climbed on deck, and the captain
took his place in the little dug-out. When they reached the
ledge he made a careful inspection of it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>ten men could certainly lie hidden here,
and with a rough parapet, constructed to look as natural as
possible, they should certainly be unobserved by an incoming
boat, especially as the attention of those in the stern
would be directed into the inlet. Will you order Mr.
Forster and one of the other midshipmen to go with as many
men as the raft will carry, and build such a parapet. They
had better take one of the rope-ladders with them and fix
it to the ledge by means of a grapnel. There is plenty of
building material among the rocks that have fallen from
the precipices above. I must leave it to their ingenuity to
make it as natural as possible.</q>
</p>

<p>
When they returned to the ship the first lieutenant called
Forster and gave him the captain’s orders.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can take young Gilmore with you,</q> he said. <q>Your
object will be to make it as natural as possible, so as to look,
in fact, as if the rocks that had fallen out behind had lodged
on the ledge. The height is not very important, for if a boat
were coming along, the men would, of course, lie down till
it was abreast of them, and the cannon would be withdrawn
and only run out at the last moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, sir, I will do my best.</q>
</p>

<p>
The raft was again brought into requisition, and it was
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>found that it could carry twelve men. Dimchurch and nine
others were chosen, and, using oars as paddles, they slowly
made their way down to the spot.
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be a difficult job to make anything like a natural
wall there,</q> Forster said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Will agreed, <q>I don’t see how it is to be managed
at all. Of course we could pile up a line of stones, but that
would not look in the least natural. If we could get up
three or four big chunks they might do if filled in with
small stones, but it would be impossible to raise great blocks
to that shelf.</q>
</p>

<p>
The ladder was fixed and they climbed up to the ledge.
When they reached it they found that it was very rough and
uneven, and consequently that the task was more difficult
than it had seemed from below.
</p>

<p>
<q>The only way I see,</q> Forster said, <q>would be to blast out
a trench six feet wide and one foot deep, in which the men
could lie hidden. The question is whether the captain will
not be afraid that the blasting might draw attention to our
presence here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They were just starting for the top of the hill when we
came away,</q> Will said, <q>and may be able to see whether
there are any habitations in the neighbourhood. A couple of
men in the dug-out would be able to bring us news of any
craft in sight. I certainly don’t see any other way.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Forster made his report the captain said:
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I believe it will be the best plan. At the top of the hill
we could see nothing but forests, for the most part levelled;
we could make out no sign of smoke anywhere. The operation
of blasting can be done with comparatively small charges, and
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>occurring as it does at the foot of a gorge like that, the sound
would hardly spread much over the surrounding country, and
we could, of course, take care that there was no ship in sight
when we fired the charges.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you can begin to-morrow. I believe there are some
blasting-tools in the store. Take the gunner with you; this
work comes within his province.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the following morning the raft went off again, and at
midday a number of sharp explosions told that the work was
begun. In the evening another series of shots were fired, and
the party returned with the news that the ground had been
broken up to the depth of two feet and of ample size to give
the men cover. The next morning the rocks were cleared out,
and a seven-pounder and carriage, with tackle for hoisting it
up, were sent over.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon the captain went in the dug-out and inspected
the work, and expressed himself as thoroughly satisfied
with it. A garrison consisting of an officer and ten men
was then placed in the fort. They remained there all day
and returned to the ship as darkness fell, as it was thought
pretty certain that no one would try to explore the inlet
during the night. The next morning another party was told
off to garrison duty, and so on, no man being given two
consecutive days in the fort.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day the dug-out returned in haste to the
ship from its post at the mouth of the gap, and reported that
two men-of-war were to be seen in the distance cruising close
inshore. Mr. Farrance landed, and with difficulty made his
way up the hill to a point near the mouth of the opening,
which commanded a view over the sea. From that point he
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>could easily see the hulls of the ships with his telescope, and
had no doubt whatever that they were the former antagonists
of the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. After watching for some time he made out
four little black specks very close to the shore. He examined
them closely and then hurried down to the cove.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are searching the coast with boats,</q> he reported,
<q>as I feared they would.</q>
</p>

<p>
The news had been given to the little party at the battery
as the dug-out came in, and they were at once on the alert.
The carpenters, who after the departure of their first boat had
been employed in building a large gig to pull twelve oars,
were at once recalled to the ship, and the magazines were
opened and the guns loaded. All the guns from the larboard
main deck had been brought up to the upper deck and port-holes
made for them, and a boom of trees had been built from
the bow and stern of the ship to the shore, so as to prevent
any craft from getting inside her. Thus prepared, the captain
considered that he was fully a match for any two ships of his
own size, but he knew, nevertheless, that, even if he beat
them off, he might be exposed to attack from a still larger
force unless assistance arrived from Jamaica.
</p>

<p>
But he did not think only of the ship. The dug-out, which
had brought Mr. Farrance back with his report, was at once
sent off with orders to the party at the battery that they
must, if possible, sink any boat or boats that entered, but that
if ships of war came in they must not try to work their gun
after the first shot, as if they did so they would simply be swept
away by the enemy’s fire. That one shot was to be aimed at
the enemy’s rudder; then they were to lie down, and if they
had not disabled the ship they were to keep up a heavy
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>musketry fire, aimed solely against her steersman. It was
hardly likely that they would be attacked by boats, as the
enemy would be fully engaged with the <name type="ship">Furious</name>; but even if
they should, the Frenchmen would have no means of climbing
the eight feet of precipitous rock.
</p>

<p>
The dug-out went to and from the entrance, bringing back
news of the progress made by the enemy’s boats. About three
hours from the time when they had first been made out by
Mr. Farrance the little boat reported that they were only two
or three hundred yards from the entrance. On board the ship
all listened anxiously, for a slight bend in the narrow passage
prevented them from seeing the battery. Presently the
boom of a cannon was heard, followed by a cheer, which told
that the little garrison had been successful; then for two or
three minutes there was a rattle of musketry. When this
stopped, the dug-out at once went out to the fort, and returned
with the news that two boats had come up abreast, that one of
them had been sunk by the cannon at the fort, and that its
crew had been picked up by the other boat, which had rowed
hastily back, suffering a good deal from the musketry fire
under which the operation was carried on.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is act one,</q> the captain said; <q>now we shall have to
look for act two. I will go up with you, Mr. Farrance, to the
place whence you saw them; we may be sure that there will be
a great deal of signalling and consultation before they make
any further step.</q>
</p>

<p>
Accordingly they landed and went up to the look-out. The
two vessels were lying close to each other with their sails
aback. The more fortunate of the two boats which had attempted
to explore the passage had just returned to them with
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>its load of wounded and the survivors of its late companion,
and boats were passing to and fro between the two ships.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is an awkward question for them to decide,</q> the captain
said. <q>Of course they know well enough that a ship must be
in here, the gun shows them that, but they cannot tell that
we are capable of making any defence beyond the single gun
battery on the ledge.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was an hour before there was any change in the position,
but at the end of that time the sails were filled and the
two vessels headed for the mouth of the inlet. They had
evidently concluded that the English ship was lying there
disabled. The two officers hurried back to the <name type="ship">Furious</name>,
and gave orders to prepare for the attack. The men at
once stood to their posts. Presently the gun of the fort
boomed out again, and by the cheering that followed the sound
it was evident that the shot had taken effect and smashed the
rudder of one of the French ships. Several guns were fired in
reply, but a minute later the bowsprit of the leading ship
came into view. The men waited until they could see the
whole vessel, then a crashing broadside from every gun on
board the <name type="ship">Furious</name> was poured into her bow.
</p>

<p>
The effect was tremendous; a hole ten or twelve feet wide
was torn in her bow, and the ship was swept from end to end
by balls and splinters, and the shrieks and groans that arose
from her told that the execution was heavy. It was evident
that the battle was already half-won as far as she was concerned.
There was not room enough in the little inlet for her
to manœuvre in the light wind so as to bring her broadside to
bear on the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, and another crashing broadside from the
latter vessel completed her discomfiture. The other vessel now
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>came up by her side, but she had been disabled by the fort,
and her helm would not act. Her captain at once lowered
her boats and tried to get her head round, but these were
smashed up by the fire of the <name type="ship">Furious</name>, and the two vessels lay
together side by side, helpless to reply in any efficient way to
the incessant fire kept up upon them. The Frenchmen did all
that was possible for brave men to do in the circumstances, but
their position was hopeless, and after suffering terribly for ten
minutes, one after the other hauled down their flag.
</p>

<p>
A tremendous burst of cheering broke from the <name type="ship">Furious</name>.
She had lost but two men killed and four or five wounded by the
bullets of the French topmen. She had also been struck twice
by balls from the bow-chaser of the second ship; but this was
the extent of her damage, while the loss of life on board the
French frigates had been frightful. Some sixty men had been
killed and eighty wounded on the first ship, while thirty were
killed and still more wounded in the boats of the second
vessel.
</p>

<p>
Captain Harker went on board the captures to receive the
swords of their commanders.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have done your best, gentlemen,</q> he said; <q>no one in
the circumstances could have done more. Had there been ten
of you instead of two the result must have been the same. If
your boats had got in and seen the situation you would have
understood that the position was an impossible one. There
was no room in here for manœuvring, and even had one of you
not been damaged by the shot from that little battery of ours,
your position would have been practically unchanged, and you
could not possibly have brought your broadsides to bear upon
us.</q>
</p>

<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>

<p>
The French captains, who were much mortified by the disaster,
bowed silently.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is the fortune of war, sir,</q> one of them said, <q>and
certainly we could not have anticipated that you would be so
wonderfully placed for defence. I agree with you that our
case was hopeless from the first, and I compliment you upon
your dispositions, which were certainly admirable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You and your officers will be perfectly at liberty,</q> the
captain said; <q>your crews must be placed in partial confinement,
but a third of them can always be on deck. My surgeon
has come on board with me, and will at once assist yours in
attending to your wounded.</q>
</p>

<p>
A considerable portion of the crew of the <name type="ship">Furious</name> were at
once put on board the French frigate <name type="ship">Eclaire</name>, and set to work
to dismantle her. The masts, spars, and rigging were transferred
to the <name type="ship">Furious</name> and erected in place of her own shattered
stumps, which were thrown overboard. Thus, after four days
of the hardest work for all, the <name type="ship">Furious</name> was again placed in
fighting trim.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were immediately made for sailing. The
<name type="ship">Furious</name> led the way, towing behind her the dismantled hull in
which the whole of the prisoners were carried. A prize crew
of sixty were placed on board the <name type="ship">Actif</name>.
</p>

<p>
When they were about half-way to Jamaica a squadron of
three vessels were sighted. Preparations were made to throw
off the <name type="ship">Eclaire</name> if the ships proved to be hostile, but before long
it was evident that they were English. They approached
rapidly, and when they rounded-to near the <name type="ship">Furious</name> the crews
manned the yards and greeted her with tremendous cheers.
The officer in command was at once rowed to the <name type="ship">Furious</name>.
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>As the boat neared the ship his friends recognized Mr. Peters
and Robson sitting in the stern.
</p>

<p>
<q>What miracle is this, Captain Harker?</q> the officer cried
as he came on deck. <q>Your lieutenant brought us news that
you were dismasted and lying helpless in some little inlet,
and here you are with what I can see is a French equipment
and a couple of prizes! I can almost accuse you of having
brought us here on a fool’s errand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must have that appearance to you; but the facts of
the case are simple;</q> and he told the story of the fight. <q>The
battle was practically over when the first shot was fired,</q> he
said. <q>The two French ships lost upwards of seventy killed
and over a hundred wounded, while we had only four men
killed and two wounded. If the place had been designed by
nature specially for defence it could not have been better
adapted for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see that,</q> Captain Ingham said; <q>but you made the
most of the advantages. Your plan of laying her broadside
to the entrance, getting all your cannon on one side, and building
a boom to prevent any vessel from getting behind you,
was most excellent. Well, it is a splendid victory, the more
so as it has been won with so little loss. The French certainly
showed but little discretion in thus running into the trap you
had prepared for them. Of course they could not tell what
to expect, but at least, whatever it might have cost them, they
ought to have sent a strong boat division in to reconnoitre.
No English captain would have risked his vessel in such a
way.</q>
</p>

<p>
With very little delay the voyage to Jamaica was continued.
Two of the relief party went straight on, the other remained
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>with the <name type="ship">Furious</name> in case she should fall in with a French
fleet. When the little squadron entered Port Royal they received
an enthusiastic welcome from the ships on the station.
Both prizes were bought into the service and handed over
to the dockyard for a thorough refit. Their names were
changed, the <name type="ship">Eclaire</name> being rechristened the <name type="ship">Sylph</name>, the <name type="ship">Actif</name>
becoming the <name type="ship">Hawke</name>. Lieutenant Farrance was promoted to
the rank of captain, and given the command of the latter
vessel, and some of the survivors of a ship that had a fortnight
before been lost on a dangerous reef were told off to
her. He was, according to rule, permitted to take a boat’s
crew and a midshipman with him from his old ship, and he
selected Will Gilmore, and, among the men, Dimchurch and
Tom Stevens.
</p>

<p>
The planters of Jamaica were celebrated for their hospitality,
and the officers received many invitations.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite at liberty to accept any of them you like,</q>
Captain Farrance said to Will. <q>Till the vessel gets out of
the hands of the dockyard men there is nothing whatever for
you to do. But I may tell you that there is a good deal of
unrest in the island among the slaves. The doings of the
French revolutionists, and the excitement they have caused
by becoming the patrons of the mulattoes has, as might be
expected, spread here, and it is greatly feared that trouble may
come of it. Of course the planters generally pooh-pooh the idea,
but it is not to be despised, and a few of them have already left
their plantations and come down here. I don’t say that you
should not accept any invitation if you like, but if an outbreak
takes place suddenly I fancy very few of the planters
will get down safely. I mean, of course, if there is a general
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>rising, which I hope will not be the case. Negroes are a good
deal like other people. Where they are well treated they
are quite content to go on as they are. Where they are badly
treated they are apt to try and better themselves. Still, that
is not always the case. There is no doubt that altogether the
French planters of San Domingo are much gentler in their
treatment of their slaves than our people are here. Large
numbers of them are of good old French families, and look on
their slaves rather as children to be ruled by kindness than
as beasts of burden, as there is no doubt some, not many, I
hope, but certainly some of the English planters do. With
San Domingo in the throes of a slave revolution, therefore,
it will not be surprising if the movement communicates itself
to the slaves here. I know that the admiral thinks it prudent
to keep an extra ship of war on the station so as to be prepared
for any emergency.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, sir. Then I will not accept invitations for
overnight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t say that, Mr. Gilmore. In nine cases out of ten
I should say it could be done without danger; for if a rebellion
breaks out it will not at first be general, but will begin at
some of the most hardly-managed plantations, and there will
be plenty of time to return to town before it spreads.</q>
</p>

<p>
As Will had no desire to mix himself up in a slave insurrection,
he declined all invitations to go out to houses beyond
a distance whence he could drive back in the evening. At all
the houses he visited he was struck by the apparently good
relations between masters and slaves. The planters were
almost aggrieved when he insisted on leaving them in the
evening, but he had the excuse that he was a sort of
aide-de-<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>camp to Captain Farrance, and was bound to be there the first
thing in the morning to receive any orders that he might have
to give. He generally hired a gig and drove over early so as
to have a long day there, and always took either Dimchurch
or Tom with him. He enjoyed himself very much, but was
not sorry when the repairs on the <name type="ship">Hawke</name> were completed.
</p>

<p>
As the admiral was anxious for her to be away, some men
were drafted from the other ships; others were recruited
from the crews of the merchantmen in the port by Dimchurch,
who spoke very highly of the life on board a man-of-war, and
of the good qualities of the <name type="ship">Hawke’s</name> commander. The complement
was completed by a draft of fresh hands from England,
brought out to make good the losses of the various
ships on the station. Within three weeks, therefore, of her
leaving the dockyard the <name type="ship">Hawke</name> sailed to join the expedition
under Sir John Laforey and General Cuyler, to capture the
island of Tobago, where, on 14th April, 1793, some troops were
landed. The French governor was summoned to surrender,
but refused, so the works were attacked and carried after a
spirited resistance. But the attempt to capture St. Pierre in the
island of Martinique was not equally successfully. The French
defended the place so desperately that the troops were re-embarked
with considerable loss.

<head>CHAPTER VII</head>

<head type="sub">AN INDEPENDENT COMMAND</head>

<p>
Will was hit by a musket-ball in the last engagement
that took place, and was sent back with a batch of
wounded to Port Royal. Three of the fingers of his left
hand had been carried away, but he bore the loss with
equanimity, as it would not compel him to leave the service.
Tom, who went with him as his servant, fretted a good deal
more over it than he himself, and was often loud in his
lamentations.
</p>

<p>
<q>It would not have made any difference if it had been me,</q>
he said, <q>but it is awfully hard on you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What ridiculous nonsense, Tom!</q> Will said quite angrily,
after one of these outbursts. <q>If it had been you it would
have been really serious, for though an officer can get on very
well without some of his fingers a sailor would be useless and
would be turned adrift with some trifling pension. I shall
do very well. I have been mentioned in despatches and I am
certain to get my step as soon as I have served long enough
to pass, so after a time I shall not miss them at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tom was silenced, though not convinced. The wound healed
rapidly, thanks to Will’s abstemious habits, and in six weeks
after entering the hospital he was discharged as fit for duty.
The <name type="ship">Hawke</name> was not in harbour, so he went to an hotel. On
the following day he received an order to call upon the admiral.
When he did so that officer received him very kindly. <q>I
am sorry,</q> he said, <q>to learn that you have lost some fingers,
Mr. Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>

<p>
<q>I hope it will not interfere much with my efficiency,
sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not,</q> the admiral said; <q>I have received the
surgeon’s report this morning. In it he stated that your
wound had from the first gone on most favourably, and that
they had really kept you in hospital a fortnight longer than
was absolutely necessary, lest in your anxiety to rejoin you
might do yourself harm. Three days since a cutter of about
a hundred tons was sent in by the <name type="ship">Sylph</name>. She was a pirate,
and, like all vessels of that class, very fast, and would most
likely have outsailed the <name type="ship">Sylph</name> had she not caught her up
a creek. I have purchased her for the government service,
and I propose to place you in command.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will gave a start of surprise. At his age he could not
have expected for a moment to be given an independent
command.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have noted your behaviour here, and have looked through
the records of your service since you joined, and I am convinced
that you will do credit to the post. I shall give you
a midshipman junior to yourself from the <name type="ship">Thetis</name>, and you will
have forty hands before the mast. The <name type="ship">Hawke</name> is expected
in in a few days, so you can pick five men from her. The
rest I will make up from the other ships. The cutter will be
furnished with four twelve-pounders, and the long sixteen as a
bow gun, which she had when she was captured. Your duty
will be to police the coasts and to overhaul as many craft as
you may find committing depredations, of course avoiding a
combat with adversaries too strong for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you most heartily, sir, for selecting me for this
service, and will do my best to merit your kindness.</q>
</p>

<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>

<p>
<q>That is all right, Mr. Gilmore. I have acted, as I believe,
for the good of the service, and to some extent as an incentive
to other young officers to use their wits.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will went out with his head in a whirl. He could hardly
have hoped, within a year of his term of service as a midshipman,
to obtain a separate command, and he could have shouted
with joy at this altogether unexpected promotion. The first
thing he did was to take a boat and row off in it to his new
command. She was a handsome boat, evidently designed to
be fast and weatherly.
</p>

<p>
<q>These beggars know how to build boats much better than
how to fight them,</q> he said, when he had examined her.
<q><corr sic="no quote">Assuredly</corr> in anything like a light wind she would run away
from the <name type="ship">Sylph</name>. The admiral was right when he said that
it was only by chance that she was caught. I hope the fellow
who is going with me is a good sort. It would be awkward
if we did not pull well together. At any rate, as the admiral
seems to have picked him out for the service, he must be worth
his salt. Of course I shall have Dimchurch as my boatswain;
he will take one watch and the youngster the other. It will
be hard if we don’t catch something.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having rowed round the cutter two or three times he
returned to the shore. As the little vessel had been taken by
surprise, and had not been able to offer any resistance to a
craft so much more powerful than herself, she was uninjured,
and was in a fit state to be immediately recommissioned. She
was called <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, a name which Will thought very suitable
for her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forty men will be none too strong for her,</q> he said, <q>for
we shall have to work two guns on each side and that long
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>one in the bow.</q> He went to bed that night and dreamt of
fierce fights and many captures, and laughed at himself when
he awoke. <q>Still,</q> he said, <q>I shall always be able to tackle
any craft of our own size and carrying anything like our
number of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
Three days later the <name type="ship">Hawke</name> came in. Will at once rowed
off to her and had a chat with his friends. When he mentioned
his new command his news was at first received with
absolute incredulity, but when at last his messmates came to
understand that he was not joking, he was heartily congratulated
on his good fortune. Afterwards he was not a little
chaffed on the tremendous deeds he and his craft were going
to perform. When at last they became serious, Latham, the
master’s mate, remarked: <q>But what is your new command
like?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a cutter of about a hundred tons, carrying four
twelve-pounders, and a sixteen-pounder long pivot gun at the
bow. I am to have forty men and a young midshipman from
the <name type="ship">Thetis</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A very tidy little craft, I should say, Gilmore, and you
will probably get a good deal more fun out of her than from
a frigate or line-of-battle ship. You will want a good
boatswain to take charge of one of the watches.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall have one, for I am to take five men out of the
<name type="ship">Hawke</name>, and you may be sure I shall take Dimchurch as boatswain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You could not have a better man,</q> Latham said; <q>he is
certainly one of the smartest fellows on board the ship. He
is very popular with all the men, and is full of life and go,
and always the first to set an example when there is any work
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>to be done. I suppose we shall also lose the services of that
boy Tom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think so,</q> Will laughed; <q>I should be quite lost without
so faithful a hand, and indeed, though he still ranks as a boy,
he is a big powerful fellow, and a match for many an A.B. at
hauling a rope or pulling an oar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right. He is as big round the chest as many of
the men, and though perhaps not so active, quite as powerful.
When will you hoist your pendant?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have to get the crew together yet. I am to have small
drafts from several of the ships, and it may be a few days
before they can be collected.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning the <name type="ship">Thetis</name> arrived, and the young midshipman
came on shore an hour later to report himself to Will.
He looked surprised for a moment at the age of his new commander,
but gravely reported himself for service. Will was
pleased with his appearance. He was a merry-faced boy, but
with a look on his face which indicated pluck and determination.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are surprised at my age, no doubt, Harman,</q> Will
said, <q>and I cannot be more than a year older than yourself,
but I have been fortunate enough to be twice mentioned in
despatches, indeed have had wonderful luck. I feel sure
that we shall get on well together, and I hope both do well.
We are to act as police on the coast of Cuba; it swarms with
pirates, and it will be hard if we don’t fall in with some of
them. You will, of course, keep one watch, and the boatswain,
who is a thoroughly good man, will take the other. I
need hardly say that we shall have no nonsense about commanding
officer. Except when on duty, I hope we shall be
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>good chums, which means, of course, that when an enemy
is in sight or the weather is dirty I must be in absolute
command.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir!</q> Harman said. <q>These are good terms,
and I promise to obey your commands as readily as if you
were old enough to be my father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good. Now I have dinner ordered and I hope
you will share it with me. We can then talk over matters
comfortably.</q>
</p>

<p>
Before dinner was over, the lad was more than satisfied with
his new chief, and felt sure that at any rate the cruise would
be a pleasant one. Just as they had finished, Dimchurch and
Tom came in to see Will. On finding that he was engaged
they would have withdrawn, but Will called them in. <q>Sit
down and join Mr. Harman and myself in a chat. This,
Harman, is Bob Dimchurch, who is going to be our boatswain,
and Tom Stevens, whom I have known since we were
five years old, and although I have gone over his head we are
as good friends as ever. Dimchurch took me under his wing
when I first joined, and since then has fought by my side on
several occasions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We came to wish you success in your new command, sir,</q>
Dimchurch said, <q>and should not have intruded had we known
that you were not alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is no intrusion at all, Dimchurch. There is no man
whose congratulations can be more pleasing to me. Have you
seen the cutter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir. Tom and I noticed what a smart, likely craft
she was when we came in and dropped anchor. I little
thought that it was you who had command of her, but I have
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>no fear but that you will do her full justice. I could hardly
believe my ears when I was told this afternoon, and Tom was
ready to jump out of his clothes with joy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is wonderfully good fortune, Dimchurch; I can hardly
believe it myself yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure you deserve it, sir. It was you who recaptured
that prize in the Mediterranean; it was you who saved the
first lieutenant’s life; and it was you who suggested a plan by
which we accounted for those three pirates. If that didn’t
deserve promotion, it is hard to say what would.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I owe no small portion of it, Dimchurch, to the fact that
I was able to take an observation so soon after I had joined,
and that was due to the kindness of my good friend Miss
Warden.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, that goes for something, no doubt, but there is a
good deal more than that in it.</q> After some further talk both
of the past and the future, Dimchurch sprang to his feet,
saying: <q>Well, sir, I wish you success. But it is time we
were off. I am told we are to remove our duds on board the
new craft to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we are going to start manning her at once; I shall
be on board with Mr. Harman directly after breakfast. I
have not put foot upon her yet, and am most anxious to do
so.</q>
</p>

<p>
The craft fully answered Will’s expectations. Her after-accommodation
was exceedingly good; the cabin was handsomely
fitted, and there were two state-rooms.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall be in clover here, Harman,</q> he said; <q>no one
could wish for a better command. I must set to work to get
stores shipped at once. How many of the crew are on board?</q>
</p>

<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>

<p>
<q>Twenty-three, sir, and I believe we shall have our full
complement before night.</q>
</p>

<p>
As they spoke a boat laden with provisions came alongside,
and all hands were at once engaged transferring her load to
the cutter. In the course of the forenoon the remainder of the
men came on board in twos and threes. After dinner Will
called the crew together and read out his commission. Then
he made his maiden speech.
</p>

<p>
<q>My lads,</q> he said, <q>I wish this to be a comfortable ship,
and I will do my best to make it so. I shall expect the ready
obedience of all; and you may be assured that if possible I
will put you in the way of gaining prize-money. There are
plenty of prizes to be taken, and I hope confidently that many
of them will fall to our share.</q> The men gave three cheers,
and Will added: <q>I will order an extra supply of grog to be
served out this evening.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the following day <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> dipped her ensign to the
admiral and set off on her voyage. Will was well pleased
with the smartness the crew displayed in getting under
weigh, and more than satisfied with the pace at which she
moved through the water. For a month they cruised off the
coast of Cuba, during which time they picked up eight small
prizes. These were for the most part rowing-galleys carrying
one large lateen sail. None of them were sufficiently strong to
show fight; they were not intended to attack merchantmen, but
preyed upon native craft, and were manned by from ten to
twenty desperadoes. Most of them, when overhauled, pretended
to be peaceful fishermen or traders, but a search always
brought to light concealed arms, and in some cases captured
goods. The boats were burned, and their crews, mostly
<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>mulattoes, with a sprinkling of negroes—rascals whose countenances
were sufficiently villainous to justify their being
hanged without trial,—were put ashore; for the admiral had
given instructions to Will not to burden himself with prisoners,
who would have to be closely guarded, and would
therefore weaken his crew, and, if brought to Port Royal,
would take up prison accommodation.
</p>

<p>
At last one day a schooner rather bigger than themselves
was sighted. Her appearance was rakish, and there was little
doubt as to her character. All sail was at once crowded on
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name>. The schooner was nearly as fast as she was, and at
the end of a six hours’ chase she was still two miles ahead.
Suddenly she headed for the shore and disappeared among
the trees. <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> proceeded on her course until opposite the
mouth of the inlet which the pirate had entered. It was
getting dark, and Will decided to wait until morning, and
then to send a boat in to reconnoitre.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have not forgotten,</q> he said to Harman, <q>the way in
which those two French frigates I have told you of ran into a
trap, and I don’t mean to be caught so if I can help it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> remained hove to during the night, and in the
morning lowered a boat, with four hands, commanded by
Dimchurch, who was ordered to row in until he obtained a
fair view of the enemy, and observe as far as possible what
preparation had been made for defence. He was absent for
half an hour, and then returned, saying that the schooner was
lying anchored with her sails stowed at the far end of the
inlet, which was about half a mile long and nearly as wide,
with her broadside bearing on the entrance.
</p>

<p>
<q>If it is as large as that,</q> Will said, <q>there will be plenty
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>of room for us to manœuvre. Did you make out what number
of guns she carried?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, she mounted four guns on each side; I should say
they were for the most part ten-pounders.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think we can reckon upon taking her. Our guns are of
heavier metal than hers, and the long-tom will make up for our
deficiency in numbers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> was put under as easy sail as would suffice to give
her manœuvring powers, and then headed for the mouth of
the inlet. She was half-way through when suddenly two
hidden batteries, each mounting three guns, opened upon her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drop the anchor at once,</q> Will shouted; <q>we will finish
with these gentlemen before we go farther.</q> The schooner at
the same time opened fire, but at half a mile range her guns
did not inflict much damage upon the cutter. Lying between
the two batteries she engaged them both, her broadside guns
firing with grape, while the long-tom sent a shot into each
alternately. In a quarter of an hour their fire was silenced,
three of the guns were dismounted, and the men who had been
working them fled precipitately.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take a boat and spike the remaining guns, Dimchurch,</q>
Will said; <q>I don’t want any more bother with them.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Dimchurch returned to the cutter, having
accomplished his mission. The anchor was then got up again,
and she proceeded to attack the schooner. <name type="ship">L’Agile’s</name> casualties
had been trifling; only one had been killed and three wounded,
all of them slightly. As she sailed up the inlet she replied
with her pivot-gun to the fire of the enemy. At every shot
the splinters were seen to fly from the schooner’s side, much
to the discomfiture of the pirate gunners, whose aim became
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>so wild that scarcely a shot struck <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>. When within a
hundred yards of the schooner the helm was put down, and
the cutter swept round and opened fire with her two broadside
guns.
</p>

<p>
The shots had scarcely rung out when Harman touched
Will on the shoulder. <q>Look there, sir,</q> he said. Will
turned and saw a vessel emerging from a side channel, which
was so closed in with trees that it had been unperceived by
anybody aboard the cutter. Her aim was evidently to get
between them and the sea. She was a cutter of about the
same size as <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, but carried six ten-pounders.
</p>

<p>
<q>The schooner has enticed us in here,</q> Will said, <q>there is no
doubt about that, and now there is nothing to do but to fight it
out. Take her head round,</q> he said, <q>we will settle it with the
cutter first. The schooner cannot come to her assistance for
some minutes as she has all her sails furled.</q>
</p>

<p>
Accordingly he ranged up to the new-comer, and a furious
contest ensued. He engaged her with two broadside guns
and the long-tom, and at the same time kept his other two
guns playing upon the schooner, the crew of which were busy
getting up sail. The long-tom was served by Dimchurch himself,
and every shot went crashing through the side of the pirate
cutter, the fire of the two broadside guns being almost equally
effective.
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep it up, lads,</q> Will shouted; <q>we shall finish with her
before the other can come up.</q> As he spoke a shot from the
long-tom struck the cutter’s mainmast, which tottered for a
moment and then fell over her side towards <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, and the
sails and hamper entirely prevented the crew from working
her guns. For another five minutes the fire was kept up;
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>then the crew were seen to be leaping overboard, and presently
a man stood up and shouted that she surrendered. The
schooner was now coming up fast.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t let her escape,</q> Will shouted; <q>she has had enough
of it, and is trying to get away. Run her aboard!</q> In a
minute the two vessels crashed together, and headed by Will,
Harman, and Dimchurch, <name type="ship">L’Agile’s</name> crew sprang on board the
schooner.
</p>

<p>
The pirate crew were evidently discouraged by the fate of
their consort and by the complete failure of their plan to
capture <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>. The captain, a gigantic mulatto, fought
desperately, as did two or three of his principal men. One of
them charged at Will while he was engaged with another,
and would have killed him had not Tom Stevens sprung forward
and caught the blow on his own cutlass. The sword
flew from the man’s hand, and Tom at once cut him down.
Dimchurch engaged in a single-handed contest with the great
mulatto captain. Strong as the sailor was he could with
difficulty parry the ruffian’s blows, but skill made up for inequality
of strength, and after a few exchanges he laid the
man low with a clever thrust. The fall of their leader completed
the discomfiture of the pirates, most of whom at once
sprang overboard and made for the shore, those who remained
being cut down by the sailors.
</p>

<p>
When at last they were masters of the ship the crew gave
three lusty cheers. But Will did not permit them to waste
precious time in rejoicing. He knew that, though they had
accomplished so much, there was still a great deal to be done,
for the prizes might even yet be recaptured before they got
them out to sea. Without a moment’s delay, therefore, he
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>sent a boat to take possession of the cutter. The sail and
wreckage were cleared away, and the boat proceeded to tow
her out of the inlet. In the meantime a warp was taken
from <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> to the schooner, the sails of the latter were
lowered, and Will sailed proudly out with his second prize in
tow. Once fairly at sea the crew began to repair damages.
Five men in all had been killed and eleven were wounded.
Several of the latter, however, were able to lend a hand. The
shot-holes in <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> were first patched with pieces of plank,
then covered with canvas, and afterwards given a coat of paint.
Then the schooner was taken in hand, and when she was got
into something like ship-shape order her sails were hoisted
again, and ten men under Harman placed on board to work
her. The cutter was taken in tow, only three men being left
on board to steer.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon before all the repairs were completed.
Before sailing, a rough examination was made of the
holds of the two vessels, and to the great satisfaction of
<name type="ship">L’Agile’s</name> crew both were found to contain a considerable
amount of booty.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is probable that there is a storehouse somewhere,</q> Will
said; <q>but as we have under thirty available men it would
be madness to try to land, for certainly two-thirds of the
scoundrels escaped by swimming, and as each craft must have
carried nearly a hundred men we should have been altogether
overmatched. Well, they had certainly a right to count upon
success; their arrangements were exceedingly good. No
doubt they expected us to leave the batteries alone, and from
the position in which they were placed they could have
peppered us hotly while we were engaged with the schooner;
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>in which case they would probably have had an easy victory.
It was a cleverly-laid trap and ought to have succeeded.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it would, sir,</q> Dimchurch said, <q>if you had not turned
from the schooner and settled with the cutter before the
other could come to her assistance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The credit is largely due to you,</q> Will said; <q>that shot
of yours that took the mast out was the turning-point of
the fight. It completely crippled her, and as it luckily fell
towards us it altogether prevented them from returning our
fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
Very proud were Will and his crew when they sailed into
Port Royal with their two prizes. Will at once rowed to the
flagship, where he received a very hearty greeting. <q>You
have not come empty-handed, I see, Mr. Gilmore,</q> the admiral
said; <q>you were lucky indeed to take two ships of your own
size one after the <corr sic="no quote">other.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We took them at the same time, sir,</q> Will said, <q>as you
will see by my report.</q>
</p>

<p>
The admiral gave a look of surprise and opened the document.
First he ran his eye over it, then he read it more
attentively. When he had finished he said: <q>You have
fought a most gallant action, Mr. Gilmore, a most gallant
action. It was indeed long odds you had against you, two
vessels each considerably over your own size and manned by
far heavier crews, besides the two batteries. It was an excellent
idea to leave the vessel with which you were first engaged and
turn upon the second one. If you had tried to fight them
both at once you would almost certainly have been overcome,
and you succeeded because you were cool enough to grasp the
fact that the schooner at anchor and with her sails down
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>would not be able to come to her friend’s assistance for some
minutes, and acted so promptly on your conclusions. The
oldest officer in the service could not have done better. I
congratulate you very heartily on your conduct. What are
the contents of the cargoes of the prizes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot say, sir. With three vessels on my hands I had
no time to examine them, but they certainly contain a number
of bales of various sorts. I opened one which contained
British goods.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then no doubt they are the pick of the cargoes they
captured,</q> the admiral said; <q>I will go off with you myself
and ascertain. I have nothing else to do this afternoon, and
it will be a matter of interest to me as well as to you. You
may as well let your own gig row back and I will take mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
Accordingly the gig was sent back to <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> with orders
for two boats to be lowered and twenty of the men to be
ready to go to the two prizes. As soon as the admiral came on
board the hatchways were opened, and the men brought up a
number of the bales. These were found to contain fine cloths,
material for women’s dresses, china, ironmongery, carpets, and
other goods of British manufacture. The other vessel contained
sugar, coffee, ginger, spices, and other products of the
islands. <q>That is enough,</q> said the admiral; <q>I don’t think
we shall be far wrong if we put down the value of those two
cargoes at £10,000. The two vessels will sell for about £1000
apiece, so that the prize-money will be altogether about
£12,000, and even after putting aside my portion you will
all share to a handsome amount in the proceeds. That is the
advantage of not belonging to a squadron. In that case your
share would not be worth anything like what it will now
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>be. By the way, since you have been absent I have received
the account of the prize-money earned by the <name type="ship">Furious</name> in the
Mediterranean and by the capture of the French frigates. It
amounts in all to £35,000. Of course as a midshipman your
share will not be very large; probably, indeed, it will not
exceed £250, so, you see, pirate-hunting in the West Indies,
in command even of a small craft, pays enormously better than
being a midshipman on board a frigate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It does indeed, sir, though £250 would be a fortune to a
midshipman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if our calculations as to the value of the cargoes and
ships are correct, you will get more than ten times that
amount now. And as there are only the flag and one other
officer to share with you, the men’s portion will be something
like £100 apiece. A few more captures like this,</q> and he
laughed, <q>and you will become a rich man.</q>
</p>

<p>
He then rowed away to his own ship, and Will returned to
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> and gladdened the hearts of Harman and the crew
with the news of the value of their captures. <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> remained
another week in harbour, during which time all signs
of the recent conflict were removed, and he received a draft
of men sufficient to bring his crew up to its former level.
Then she again set sail.
</p>

<p>
They had cruised for about a fortnight when one morning,
just as Will was getting up, Dimchurch ran down and reported
that they had sighted two sails suspiciously near each other.
<q>One,</q> he said, <q>looks to me a full-rigged ship, and the other
a large schooner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will have a look at them,</q> Will said, and, putting on his
clothes, he ran on deck.
</p>

<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, it certainly looks suspicious,</q> he said, when he had
examined them through his telescope; <q>we will head towards
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She looks to me a very large schooner, sir,</q> said Dimchurch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she is larger than these pirates generally are, but
there is very little doubt as to her character. How far are
they off, do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ten miles, sir, I should say; but we have got the land-breeze
while they are becalmed. By the look of the water
I should say we should carry the wind with us until we are
pretty close to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every sail the cutter could carry was hoisted, and she
approached the two vessels rapidly. They were some four
miles from them when the sails of the schooner filled and she
began to move through the water.
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be a long chase now,</q> Will said; <q>but the cutter
has light wings, so we have a good chance of overhauling
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The sails of the ship are all anyhow, sir,</q> Harman said.
</p>

<p>
<q>So they are, Mr. Harman; foul play has been going on
there, I have not the least doubt. The fact that the crew
are not making any effort to haul in her sheets and come to
meet us is in itself a proof of it. I think it is our duty to
board her and see what has taken place. Even if we allow
the schooner to escape we shall light upon her again some
day, I have no doubt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is very low in the water,</q> he said, after examining
the merchantman carefully through his telescope, <q>and either
her cargo is of no value to the pirates, and they have allowed
it to remain in her, or they have scuttled her.</q>
</p>

<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>

<p>
<q>I am afraid it is that, sir,</q> Dimchurch said, <q>for she is
certainly lower in the water than when I first saw her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right, Dimchurch, the scoundrels have scuttled
her. Please God we shall get to her before she founders!
Oh for a stronger wind! Do you think we could row there
quicker than we sail?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. The gig might go as fast as the cutter, but the
other boat would not be able to keep pace with her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, make all preparations for lowering. Heaven only
knows what tragedy may have taken place there.</q>
</p>

<p>
After all had been got ready, every eye on board the cutter
was fixed on the vessel. There was no doubt now that she was
getting deeper in the water every minute. When they got
within a quarter of a mile of the ship she was so low that
it was evident she could not float many minutes longer.
</p>

<p>
<q>To the boats, men,</q> Will cried, <q>row for your lives.</q>
</p>

<p>
A moment later three boats started at full speed. The
gig, in which Dimchurch and Tom were both rowing, was
first to search the sinking ship. Will leapt on board at once,
and as he did so he gave an exclamation of horror, for the
deck was strewn with dead bodies. Without stopping to look
about him he ran aft to the companion and went down to the
cabin, which was already a foot deep in water. There he
found some fifteen men and women sitting securely bound
on the sofas. Will drew his dirk, and running along cut
their thongs.
</p>

<p>
<q>Up on deck for your lives,</q> he cried, <q>and get into the
boats alongside; she will not float three minutes.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the farther end of the cabin a young girl was kneeling
by the side of a stout old lady, who had evidently fainted.
</p>
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
<p>
<q>Come,</q> Will said, going up to her, <q>it is a matter of life
and death; we shall have the water coming down the companion
in a minute or two.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can’t leave her,</q> the girl cried.
</p>

<p>
Will attempted to lift the old lady, but she was far too
heavy for him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot save her,</q> he said, and raised a shout for Dimchurch.
It was unanswered. <q>There,</q> he said, <q>the water
is coming down; she will sink in a minute. I cannot save
her—indeed she is as good as dead already—but I can save
you,</q> and snatching the girl up he ran to the foot of the
companion. The water was already pouring down, but he
struggled up against it, and managed to reach the deck; but
before he could cross to the side the vessel gave a sudden
lurch and went down. He was carried under with the suck,
but by desperate efforts he gained the surface just as his
breath was spent. For a moment or two he was unable to
speak, but he was none the less ready to act. Looking round he
saw a hen-coop floating near, and, swimming to it, he clung
to it with one arm while he held the girl’s head above water
with the other. Then, when he had recovered his breath, he
shouted <q>Dimchurch!</q> Fortunately the gig was not far
away, and his hail was at once answered, and a moment later
the boat was alongside the hen-coop.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
<q>Take this young lady, Dimchurch, and lay her in the
stern-sheets. She can’t be dead, for she was sensible when
the ship went down, and we were not under water a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
After the girl had been laid down, Will was helped in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did we save them all?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir; at least I think so. They all came running on
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>deck and jumped straight into the boats. I was busy helping
them, and did not notice that you were missing. As the last
seemed to have come up, I called to the other boats to make
off, for I saw that she could only float a minute longer, and
as it was we had only just got clear when she went down.
Indeed we had a narrow escape of it, and the men had to
row. I was standing up to look for you, and had just discovered
that you were not in any of the boats, when I heard
you call. It gave me a bad turn, as you may guess, sir, and
glad I was when I saw you were holding on to that hen-coop.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, let us try and bring this young lady round,</q> Will
said.
</p>

<p>
They turned her over first upon her face and let the water
run out of her mouth. Then they laid her flat on her back
with a jersey under her head, and rubbed her hands and feet
and pressed gently at times on her chest. After five minutes
of this treatment the girl heaved a sigh, and shortly afterwards
opened her eyes and looked round in bewilderment at
the faces of the men. Then suddenly she realized where she
was and remembered what had happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, it was dreadful!</q> she murmured. <q>Poor Miss Morrison
was lost, was she not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If that was the name of the lady you were kneeling
by I regret to say that she was. It was impossible to save
her; for though I tried my best I could not lift her. As you
call her Miss Morrison I presume she is not a close relation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she had been my governess since I was a child, and
has been a mother to me. Oh, to think that she is dead
while I am saved!</q>
</p>

<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>

<p>
<q>You must remember that it might have been worse,</q> Will
said; <q>you certainly cannot require a governess many more
years, and will find others on whom to bestow your affection.
How old are you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am fourteen,</q> the girl said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, here is my ship, and we will all do our best to
make you comfortable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your ship!</q> the girl said in surprise; <q>do you mean to
say that you are in command of her? You do not look more
than a boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not much more than a boy,</q> he said with a smile,
<q>but for all that I am the commander of this vessel, and this
young gentleman is my second in command.</q>

<head>CHAPTER VIII</head>

<head type="sub">A SPLENDID HAUL</head>

<p>
When all were got on board, and the boats hoisted to the
davits, Will conducted the ladies down to the cabin,
which he handed over to them. Then, having ordered the
cook to prepare some hot soup for the girl he had rescued, he
came on deck again and questioned the male passengers.
</p>

<p>
<q>We were all dressing for dinner,</q> one said, <q rend="post: none">when we
heard a shouting on deck. Almost immediately there was
a great bump, which knocked most of us off our feet, and we
thought that we had been run into, but directly afterwards
we heard a great tumult going on above us, and we guessed
that the ship had been attacked by pirates. The clashing of
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>swords and the falling of bodies went on for two or three
minutes, and then there was a loud savage yell that told us
that the pirates had taken the ship. Next moment the
ruffians rushed down upon us, took away any valuables we
had about our persons, and then tied us up and threw us on
the sofas. After scouring all the cabins they left us, and by
the noise that followed we guessed that they had removed
the hatches and were getting up the cargo.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This continued all night, and some time this morning we
heard the brutes going down to their boats, and thanked God
that they had spared our lives. Presently all became still;
but after a time we saw the water rising on the floor, and the
dreadful thought struck us that they had scuttled the ship
and left us to perish. One of us managed, in spite of his
bonds, to make his way up the companion and endeavour to
open the door. He found, however, to his horror that it was
fastened outside. Time after time he flung himself against
it, but it would not yield. The water rose higher and higher,
and we were waiting for the end when, to our delight, we
heard a bump as of a boat coming alongside the vessel, then
the sound of someone running along the deck and of the
companion door being hurriedly opened. You know the rest.
The ship was the <name type="ship">Northumberland</name> of Bristol.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God we arrived in time!</q> Will said. <q>It was an
affair of seconds. If we had been two minutes later you
would all have been drowned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What has become of that terrible pirate?</q> asked one of
the passengers.
</p>

<p>
<q>There he is, six miles away. I hope some day to avenge
the murder of your captain and crew.</q>
</p>

<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>

<p>
<q>But his ship looks a good deal larger than yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Will said, <q>but we don’t take much account of size.
We captured two pirates in one fight, both of them bigger
than ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And your ship looks such a small thing, too, in comparison
with our vessel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, your ship could pretty well take her up and carry
her. Weight doesn’t go for much in fighting.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And are you really her commander?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have that honour. I am a midshipman, and before I
got command of <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> I was on board His Majesty’s ships
<name type="ship">Furious</name> and <name type="ship">Hawke</name>. I had a great deal of luck in several
fights we came through, and as a result was entrusted by the
admiral with the command of this vessel. As you say, she is
small, but her guns are heavy for her size, and are more than
a match for most of those carried by the pirates.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, in the name of myself and all my fellow-passengers
I offer you my sincerest thanks for the manner in
which you saved our lives. How close a shave it was is shown
by the fact that you were yourself unable to get off the ship
in time and were carried down with her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was all in the way of business,</q> Will laughed. <q>We
were after the pirates, and when we saw the state of your
vessel we reluctantly gave up the chase in order to see if we
could be of any assistance. I expect the schooner wouldn’t
have run away from us had she not been so full of the cargo
she got from your ship. They could not have had time to
stow it all below, and it would have hampered them in working
their guns, besides probably affecting their speed. I shall
know her again when I see her, and then will try if these
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>scoundrels are as good at fighting as they are at cold-blooded
murder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are you going now, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am cruising at present, and am master of my own movements,
so if you will let me know where you are bound for, I
will try to set as many of you down at your destination as
I can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Most of us are bound for Jamaica, sir, and the others will
be able to find their way to their respective islands from there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, then, I will head for Jamaica at once. In the
meantime my cabin and that of my second in command are
at the service of the ladies. There are the sofas, too, in the
saloon, and if these are not enough I will get some hammocks
slung. I shall myself sleep on deck, and those of you who
prefer it can do the same; for the others I will have hammocks
slung in the hold.</q>
</p>

<p>
Most of the ladies soon came up, but the girl Will had
saved did not appear till the next morning. She was very
pretty, and likely to be more so. If he had allowed her she
would have overwhelmed him with thanks, but he made light
of the whole affair. He learned from the other passengers
that she was the daughter of one of the richest merchants in
Jamaica. At the death of her mother, when she was five
years old, she was sent home to England in charge of the
governess who had been drowned in the <name type="ship">Northumberland</name>, and
when this catastrophe occurred had been on her way to rejoin
her father. Although saddened by the death of her old friend,
she soon showed signs of a disposition naturally bright and
cheerful. She bantered Will about his command, and professed
to regard <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> as a toy ship, expressing great
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>wonder that it was not manned by boy A.B.’s as well as
boy officers.
</p>

<p>
<q>It must surely seem very ridiculous to you,</q> she said, <q>to
be giving orders to men old enough to be your father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can quite understand that it seems so to you,</q> he said,
<q>for it does to me sometimes; but custom is everything, and
I don’t suppose the men give the matter a thought. At any
rate they are as ready to follow me as they are the oldest
veteran in the service.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will carried all the sail he could set, as he was anxious to
get the craft free from passengers and to be off in search of
the schooner that had escaped him. He was again loaded
with thanks by the passengers when they landed, and after
seeing them off he went and made his report to the admiral.
</p>

<p>
<q>How is this, Mr. Gilmore?</q> the admiral said as he entered
the cabin; <q>no prizes this time? And who are all those people
I saw landing just now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Will handed in his report; but, as usual, the admiral insisted
on hearing all details.
</p>

<p>
<q>But your uniform looks shrunk, Mr. Gilmore,</q> he said
when Will had finished. <q>You said nothing about being in
the water!</q>
</p>

<p>
Will was then obliged to relate how he had rescued the girl
from the cabin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done again, young sir! it is a deed to be as proud
of as the capturing of those two pirates. Well done, indeed!
Now I suppose you want to be off again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, I should like to sail as soon as possible; in the first
place, because I am most anxious to fall in with that schooner
and bring the captain and crew in here to be hanged.</q>
</p>

<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>

<p>
<q>That is a very laudable ambition. And why in the second
place?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because I want to get off before a lot of people come to
thank me for saving their relatives, and so on, sir. If I get
away at once, then I may hope that before I come back again
the whole thing will be forgotten.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It oughtn’t to be, for you acted very wisely and gallantly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I don’t want a lot of thanks for only doing what
was my duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very good, Mr. Gilmore, I understand your feelings, but
I quite expect that when you do return you will have to go
through the ordeal of being presented with a piece of plate,
and probably after that you will have to attend a complimentary
ball. Now, you can go back to your ship at once.
Here is a letter to the chief of the store department instructing
him to furnish you with any stores you may want without
waiting for my signature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much, sir! I hope, when I return, that I
shall bring that pirate in tow. Can I have three months from
the present time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, and I hope you will be able to make good use
of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Returning to his ship, Will at once made out the list of the
stores he required, and sent Harman on shore with it, telling
him to take two boats and bring everything back with him.
At five o’clock in the afternoon the two boats returned, carrying
all the stores required. The water-tanks had already been
filled up, and a quarter of an hour later the cutter was under
sail and leaving the harbour.
</p>

<p>
Will, of course, had nothing whatever to guide him in his
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>search for the schooner beyond the fact that she was heading
west at the time when he last saw her. At that time they
were to the south of Porto Rico, so he concluded that she was
making for Cuba. Every day, therefore, he cruised along the
coast of that island, sometimes sending boats ashore to examine
inlets, at other times running right out to sea in the hope that
the pirate, whose spies he had no doubt were watching his
movements, might suppose he had given up the search and was
sailing away. Nevertheless, he could not be certain that she
would endeavour to avoid him should she catch sight of him,
for with a glass the pirate captain could have made out the
number of guns <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> carried, and would doubtless feel
confident in his own superiority, as he would not be able to
discover the weight of the guns. Will felt that if the pirate
should fight, his best policy would be at first to make a pretence
of running, in the hope that in a long chase he might
manage to knock away some of the schooner’s spars.
</p>

<p>
One day he saw the boats, which had gone up a deep inlet,
coming back at full speed<corr sic=".+dq">.</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>We saw a schooner up there,</q> Harman reported; <q>I think
she is the one we are in search of. When we sighted her she
was getting up sail.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That will just suit me. We will run out to sea at once;
that will make him believe we are afraid of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had the boats been got on board, and the cutter’s
head turned offshore, when the schooner was seen issuing
from the inlet. Will ordered every sail to be crowded on,
and had the satisfaction of seeing the schooner following his
example. He then set the whole of the crew to shift the long-tom
from the bow to the stern. Its muzzle was just high
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>enough to project above the taffrail, and in order to hide it
better he had hammocks and other material piled on each side
of it so as to form a breastwork three feet high.
</p>

<p>
<q>They will think,</q> he said, <q>that we have put this up as a
protection against shot from his bow-chasers.</q>
</p>

<p>
After watching the schooner for a quarter of an hour, Will
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t think she gains upon us at all; lower a sail over
the bow to deaden her way. A small topsail will do; I only
want to check her half a knot an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was an hour before the schooner yawed and fired her
bow-guns.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good,</q> Will said to Dimchurch; <q>it shows that
she doesn’t carry a long-tom. I thought she didn’t, but they
might have hidden it, as we have done. Don’t answer them
yet; I don’t want to fire till we get within half a mile of her;
then they shall have it as hot as they like.</q>
</p>

<p>
The schooner continued to gain slowly, occasionally firing
her bow-chasers. When she had come up to within a mile of
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> the cutter was yawed and two broadside guns fired;
they were purposely aimed somewhat wide, as Will was
anxious that the pirates should not suspect the weight of
his metal, and did not wish, by inflicting some small injury,
to deter her from continuing the chase. The schooner evidently
depended upon the vastly superior strength of her
crew to carry the cutter by boarding, and so abstained from
attempting to injure her, as the less damage she suffered the
better value she would be as a prize.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are not more than half a mile off now, I think, sir,</q>
Dimchurch said at last.
</p>

<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>

<p>
<q>Very well then, we will let her have it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The gun was already loaded, so Dimchurch took a steady
aim and applied the match. All leapt upon the bulwarks to
see the effect of the shot, and a cheer broke from the crew as
it struck the schooner on the bow, about four feet above the
water. In return the schooner yawed so as to bring her whole
broadside to bear on the cutter, and six tongues of flame
flashed from her side. At the same moment <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> swung
round and fired her two starboard guns. Both ships immediately
resumed their former positions, and as they did so
Dimchurch fired again, his shot scattering a shower of splinters
from almost the same spot as the other had struck.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must elevate your gun a little more, Dimchurch,</q>
said Will, <q>and bring a mast about their ears. Get that sail
on board!</q> he shouted; <q>I don’t want the schooner to get
any nearer.</q>
</p>

<p>
The order was executed, and the difference in the speed of
the cutter was at once manifest. Again and again Dimchurch
fired. Several of the shot went through the schooner’s foresail,
but as yet her masts were untouched.
</p>

<p>
<q>A little more to the right, Dimchurch.</q>
</p>

<p>
This time the sailor was longer than usual in taking aim,
but when he fired the schooner’s foremast was seen to topple
over, and her head flew up into the wind, thus presenting her
stern to the cutter.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a lame duck now,</q> Will said, <q>but we may as well
take her mainmast out of her too. Fire away, and take as
good aim as you did last time.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ten more shots were fired, and with the last the pirate’s
mainmast went over the side.
</p>

<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>

<p>
<q>Well done, Dimchurch! Now we have her at our mercy.
We will sail backwards and forwards under her stern and
rake her with grape. I don’t want to injure her more than
is necessary, but I do want to kill as many of the crew as
possible; it is better for them to die that way than to be
taken to Jamaica to be hanged.</q>
</p>

<p>
For an hour the cutter kept at work crossing and recrossing
her antagonist’s stern, and each time she poured in a volley
from two broadside guns and the long-tom. The stern of
the schooner was knocked almost to pieces, and the grape-shot
carried death along her decks.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am only afraid that they will blow her up,</q> Will said;
<q>but probably, as they have not done so already, her captain
and most of her officers are killed, for it would require a
desperado to undertake that job.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last the black flag was hoisted on a spar at the stern,
and then lowered again. When they saw this the crew of
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> stopped firing, and sent up cheer after cheer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now we must be careful, sir,</q> Dimchurch said; <q>those
scoundrels are quite capable of pretending to surrender, and
then, when we board her, blowing their ship and us into the
air.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right, Dimchurch. They might very well do
that, for they must know well enough that they can expect
no mercy.</q>
</p>

<p>
Bringing the cutter to within a hundred yards of the
schooner, Will shouted:
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you a boat that can swim?</q> and receiving a reply in
the negative, shouted back: <q>Very well, then, I will drop one
to you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>

<p>
He then placed the cutter exactly to windward of the
schooner, and, lowering one of the boats, to which a rope was
attached, let it drift down to the prize.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> he shouted, <q>fasten a hawser to that boat; the
largest you have.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was evidently some discussion among the few men
gathered on the deck of the pirate, and, seeing that they hesitated,
Will shouted:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do as you are ordered, or I will open fire again.</q>
</p>

<p>
This decided the pirates, and in a short time the end of a
hawser was tied to one of the thwarts of the boat. The boat
was then hauled back to <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, and when the cable was got
on board it was knotted to their own strongest hawser.
</p>

<p>
<q>That will keep them a good bit astern,</q> Will said; <q>otherwise,
if the wind were to drop at night, they might haul their
own vessel up to us, and carry out their plan of blowing us
up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is wise to take every precaution, sir,</q> Harman said;
<q>but I don’t think any trick of that sort would be likely to
succeed. You may be sure we should keep too sharp a watch
on them.</q>
</p>

<p>
While the hawsers were being spliced, Will shouted to the
pirates to cut away the wreckage from their ship, and when
this was done he started with his prize in tow. As soon as
they were fairly under weigh he hailed the prisoners through
his speaking-trumpet and questioned them about their casualties.
They replied that at the beginning of the engagement
they had had one hundred and twenty men on board. The
captain had been killed by the first volley of grape, and the
slaughter among the crew had been terrible, all the officers
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>being killed and eighty of the men. The remainder had run
down into the hold, and remained there until, after a consultation,
one of them crawled up on deck and hoisted and lowered
the black flag.
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose,</q> Will said, <q>your intention was to blow the
ship and yourselves and us into the air as soon as we came
on board.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is just what we did mean,</q> one of them shouted
savagely; <q>if we could but have paid you out we would not
have minded what became of ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is well, indeed, Dimchurch, that you suggested the possibility
of their doing this to us. But for that we should
certainly have lost nearly all our number, for, not knowing
how many of the crew survived, I could not have ventured to
go on board without pretty nearly every man. It will be a
lesson to me in future, when I am fighting pirates, to act as if
they were wild beasts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I don’t know that they are altogether to be
blamed; it is only human nature to pay back a blow for a
blow, and with savages like these, especially when they know
that they are bound to be hanged, you could hardly expect
anything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose not, Dimchurch, and certainly for myself I would
rather be blown up than hanged. I suppose the reason why
they did not blow up the ship when they found their plan
had failed was that they clung to life even for a few days.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expect it is that, sir; besides, you know, each man may
think that although no doubt the rest will be hanged, he himself
may get off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I dare say that has something to do with it,</q> Will
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>agreed. <q rend="post: none">I don’t think it likely, however, that any one of
them will be spared after that affair of the <name type="ship">Northumberland</name>,
and very probably that was only one of a dozen ships destroyed
in the same way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, Harman, we will put her head round and sail
back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sail back, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly; I think there is no doubt that that inlet is the
pirates’ head-quarters, and that they are certain to have storehouses
there choke-full of plunder. Some of their associates
will in that case be on shore looking after it, and if their ship
doesn’t return they will divide the most valuable portion of
these stores among themselves, and set fire to all the rest.
We have done extremely well so far, but another big haul
will make matters all the pleasanter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what will you do with the prize?</q> asked Harman.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will cast her off eight or ten miles from the shore; they
have no boats, and the schooner is a mere log on the water.
When we see what plunder they have collected I shall be able
to decide how to act. The cutter can hold a great deal, but if
we find more than she can carry we must load the schooner
also.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what would you do with the pirates in that case, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should try to make them come off in batches, and then
iron them; but if they would not do that, I should be inclined
to tow the schooner to within half a mile of the shore, and so
give all that could swim the chance of getting away. Those
of them that are unable to do so would probably manage to
get off on spars or hatchways. They have been richly punished
already, and I fancy the admiral would be much better pleased
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>to see the schooner come in loaded with valuable plunder than
if she carried only forty scoundrels to be handed over to the
hangman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if we were to let them escape we should have to take
great care on shore while we were rifling the storehouse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may be sure that I should do that, Harman. The
fellows could certainly take no firearms on shore, and I should
keep ten men with loaded muskets always on guard, while
those who are at work would have their firearms handy to
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
They towed the schooner to within seven or eight miles of
the shore, and then cast her off and made for the creek from
which the pirates had come out. As they entered the inlet,
which was two miles long, they could see no signs of houses,
so they sailed as far as they could and anchored. Will then
landed with a party of ten well-armed men, and at once began
to make a careful examination of the beach. In a short time
they found a well-beaten path going up through the wood.
Before following this, however, Will took the precaution to
have fifteen more men sent ashore, as it was, of course, impossible
to say how many of a guard had been left at the
head-quarters. When the second party had landed, all advanced
cautiously up the path, holding their muskets in
readiness for instant action. They met, however, with no
opposition; the pirates were evidently unaware of their presence.
They had gone but a very short distance when they
came to a large clearing, in the middle of which they saw
several large huts and three great storehouses. They went
on at the double towards them, but they had gone only a
short distance when they heard a shout and a shot, and saw
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>a dozen men and a number of women issue from the backs of
the huts and make for the wood.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, my lads,</q> shouted Will, <q>break open the doors of
those storehouses; there is not likely to be much that is of
value in the huts. You had better take four men, Dimchurch,
and set fire to them all; of course you can just look in and
see if there is anything worth taking before you apply a light.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will himself superintended the breaking open of the storehouses.
When he entered the first he paused in amazement;
it was filled to the very top with boxes and bales. The other
two were in a similar condition.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is enough to fill the cutter and the prize a dozen
times,</q> Will said. <q>I expect they trade to some extent with
the Spaniards, but they evidently had another intention in
storing these goods. Probably they proposed, when they had
amassed sufficient, to charter a large ship, fill her up to the
hatchways, and sail to some American port or some other place
where questions are not usually asked.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a safe in the corner of one of the storehouses;
this they blew open, and when Will examined its contents
he found that they consisted of the papers and manifests of
cargoes of no fewer than eleven ships.
</p>

<p>
<q>My conjecture was right,</q> he said. <q>They intended, no
doubt, to keep some large merchantman they had captured,
fill her with the contents of their prizes, and then with the
papers and manifests of cargo they could go almost anywhere
and dispose of their ill-gotten goods.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no doubt that is so, sir,</q> Dimchurch said; <q>I only
wonder they did not set about it before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is quite possible they have done so already,</q> Will said,
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/><q>but they may have taken prizes quicker than they could
dispose of them, which would account for this immense accumulation.
Now, Dimchurch, I will sit down and go through
those bills of lading and pick out the most valuable goods.
We will then take these off to begin with, and can leave it
to the admiral to send a man-of-war or charter some merchantman
to bring the rest. The schooner should carry between
two and three hundred tons, and we could manage to cram
eighty or a hundred into our hold. If we get all that safely
to Jamaica, we need not grieve much if we find that the rest
of the goods have been burned before the ships can come to
fetch them.</q>
</p>

<p>
It took him three hours to go through the bills of lading,
making a mark against all the most valuable goods. Then
some of the men were set to sort these out. There was no
great difficulty about this, as the goods had been very neatly
stored, those belonging to each ship being separated by narrow
passages from the rest. The remainder of the men except two
were meanwhile brought from the cutter. Sentries were then
placed to watch all the approaches to the storehouses, and
while ten men got out the bales and boxes, the remaining
twenty-six carried them down the path. At night half the
men remained in the storehouses, the other half returning to
the cutter.
</p>

<p>
Before sunset Will went with a small escort to the top of a
neighbouring hill to see that all was well with the hulk of the
schooner. With the aid of his telescope he could see her
plainly, and to his great satisfaction noted that she had made
but little drift.
</p>

<p>
The next morning the work was resumed, and was carried
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>on all day with only short breaks for meals, and so on the
following two days. At the end of that time as much had
been put on board the cutter as she could carry. Ten men
were then left to guard the stores, and the rest, going on board,
sailed out to the schooner and towed her in. They did not,
as was at first intended, stop a mile outside the inlet, but came
right into it and anchored opposite the path, as the labour of
continually loading the cutter and then transferring her cargo
to the hulk would have been very great. The next morning
a party of twelve men went on board her, and found, as Will
had expected, that she was entirely deserted.
</p>

<p>
<q>They will be too happy at having made their escape to do
anything for the next day or two,</q> Will said, <q>so we can go
on working as usual. Fortunately the fellows who were left
in the huts were taken so completely by surprise that they
bolted at once and left their guns behind. If, therefore, they
are joined by their friends from the schooner, and attack us, they
will have no firearms with them, for, as the hulk is anchored
about two hundred yards from shore, it would require a
marvellously good swimmer to carry his musket and ammunition
ashore with him. In future, however, we will leave
twenty men to guard the storehouses at night; there is no
boat in the inlet by means of which they could attack the
cutter, and they are not likely to try to do so by swimming.
At any rate, Harman, I will place you in command of her,
and shall therefore feel perfectly confident that we shall not
be taken by surprise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can trust me for that, sir; I promise you that I will
sleep with one eye open, though I don’t think they would be
likely to attempt such an enterprise. They are much more
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>likely to attack you at the stores. I think it would be advisable
to take twenty-five men with you and leave me with
fifteen, which would be ample. I should divide them into
two watches, so that there would always be seven on deck.
Jefferson, who is an uncommonly sharp fellow, would be in
charge of one of the watches, and Williams of the other; and
as I should myself be up and down all night, there would be
no chance of our being caught napping.</q> Will agreed to this
arrangement.
</p>

<p>
The prize was now brought close inshore, the water being
deep enough to allow of this. It was a great advantage, as
the goods could be put on board direct, and the work was
thereby greatly accelerated.
</p>

<p>
Behind a pile of goods another safe was discovered, and this
was found to contain £8500 in money, nearly a hundred
watches, and a large amount of ladies’ jewellery. Many
watches had also been found in the huts before these were
burned. The bales and boxes contained chiefly spices, silks
and sateens, shawls, piece-goods, and coffee.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the fourth day after the escape of the
prisoners one of the sentries perceived a dark mass moving
from the wood. He at once fired his musket, and in a minute
Will and Dimchurch, with their five-and-twenty men, were all
in readiness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, my men,</q> Will said, <q>these fellows will attempt to
rush us. We will divide into three parties and will fire by
volleys; one party must not fire till they see that all are
loaded. In that way we shall always have sixteen muskets
ready for them. I have no fear of the result, and even if they
close with us our cutlasses will be more than a match for their
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>knives. Here they come! Get ready, the first section, and
don’t fire till I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The enemy, fully sixty strong, came on with fierce cries,
knowing that the garrison were on guard, although they
could not see them in the shadow of the storehouses. When
they got within fifty yards Will gave the order to fire, and
the first eight muskets flashed out. The second eight fired
almost immediately after, and the third eight, waiting only
till the first section had reloaded, followed suit. Nearly every
shot told, and the shock was so great that it caused the
advancing enemy to hesitate for a moment. This gave the
second and third sections time to reload, so that, when the
pirates again advanced, three more deadly volleys were poured
into them in quick succession. The effect of these was instantaneous.
Fully five-and-thirty had been brought to the
ground by the six volleys; the remainder halted, swayed for a
moment, then turned and fled at full speed, pursued, however,
before they reached the wood, by another general discharge.
</p>

<p>
Will was well pleased with the tremendously heavy punishment
he had inflicted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Out of the sixty men who attacked us,</q> he said to Harman
the next morning, <q>I calculate that forty belonged to
the schooner. I don’t suppose they were worse than the other
twenty; but we had ourselves seen some of the crimes they
had committed. We have accounted for forty in all, so of
those who escaped from the schooner probably some five- or
six-and-twenty have been killed. After such a thrashing they
are not likely to make another attempt.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was right. The work now went on undisturbed, and
at the end of a fortnight the schooner was laden. All the
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>hatches had been closed and made water-tight; and so full
was she that her deck was only two feet and a half above
the water, although her guns had been thrown overboard or
landed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now I think we are all ready to sail,</q> Harman said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ready to sail! We have a fortnight’s hard work before
us,</q> said Will. <q>You don’t suppose I am going to leave all
these hogsheads of sugar, puncheons of rum, and bales of goods
to be burnt or destroyed by those scoundrels.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you prevent it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very easily. There are plenty of materials on the spot to
form four batteries, one on each side of the storehouses. We
will drag up eight of the schooner’s guns and mount two on
each battery; they shall be loaded and crammed to the muzzle
with grape-shot. The batteries shall be built clear of the
storehouses and in echelon, so that if one is attacked it can
be supported by the others. As a garrison I will leave sixteen
men under Dimchurch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dimchurch was called up and the matter explained to him,
and he readily agreed to take charge.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two men,</q> he said, <q>can be on watch in each battery
while the others sleep; so there will be no chance of being
taken by surprise, and you may be quite sure that, no matter
how strong a mob may come down, they won’t stand the discharge
of eight cannon loaded as you say. I suppose, sir, you
mean to form the batteries of bales of cotton. There is a
whole ship-load of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is my intention, Dimchurch; I have had it in my
mind all the time.</q>
</p>

<p>
The whole strength of the crew, with the exception of two
<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>to watch on board the cutter, now went up to the storehouses,
and the men, delighted to know that all this booty was not
to be lost, set to work with great vigour. Will marked out
the sites for the batteries, and the bales of cotton were rolled
to them and built up into substantial walls. It took ten days
of hard labour to do this and haul up the guns.
</p>

<p>
When the work was completed Dimchurch chose sixteen
of the crew. There was an ample supply of provisions, which
had been taken out of the huts before they were burnt; so
it was not necessary to draw upon the stores of the cutter.
When all was ready the two parties said good-bye, and, with
a mutual cheer, the cutter’s crew went on board.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a hazardous business, I admit,</q> Will said, as, having
got up sail, they moved down the inlet with the schooner in
tow. <q>Of course I shall be a little uneasy until we can
return from Jamaica and relieve Dimchurch; but I feel convinced
that he will be able to hold his own and to give another
lesson to the pirates if necessary. When they see us
sail out they will naturally conclude that no great number can
be left to guard the stores. Still, we may be sure that they
have kept a watch on our doings from the edge of the forest,
and that the sight of the guns will inspire a wholesome dread
in them. I cannot but think that eight discharges of grape
and langrage will send them to the right-about however strong
they may be. Besides, we have given the men three muskets
each, in addition to their own, from those we found on board
the schooner; so if the enemy press on they will be able
to give them a warm reception. And then, even if the attack
is too much for them, they have still a resource, for we have
left an exit in the rear of each battery by which they can
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>retire to the storehouses. I have instructed them to carry
all their muskets back with them; sixteen men with four
muskets apiece could make a very sturdy defence. As you
know, I had the doors repaired and strengthened and loopholes
cut in the walls. Still, I don’t think they will be needed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How much do you think the prize will be worth?</q> Harman
asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have really no idea, but I am sure that what we have
got here and in the schooner must be worth some thousands of
pounds. What we have left behind must be the contents of
about ten vessels, as all we have been able to take is only a
full cargo for one good-sized <corr sic="no quote">ship.</corr></q>

<head>CHAPTER IX</head>

<head type="sub">A SPELL ASHORE</head>

<p>
Ten days later they arrived at Jamaica, and Will at once
went to make his report to the admiral.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> the admiral said heartily, <q>you have brought in
another prize, Mr. Gilmore. She looks a mere hulk, and is
remarkably deep in the water. What is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is the schooner that sank the <name type="ship">Northumberland</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must have knocked her about terribly, for she is
evidently sinking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir, she is all right except that the stern is shattered.
We have covered it over with tarpaulins backed by battens;
otherwise she is almost uninjured.</q>
</p>

<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>

<p>
<q>I am glad, indeed, to hear that you have caught that
scoundrel, Mr. Gilmore, but I hardly think she can be worth
towing in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is worth a good deal, sir, for both she and the cutter
are choke-full of loot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indeed!</q> the admiral said in a tone of gratification. <q>In
that case she must be valuable; but let me hear all about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have stated it in my report, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you always leave out a good deal in your report.
Please give me a full account of it. First, how many guns
did she carry?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Six guns a-side, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you must have done wonders. Now tell me all
about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will modestly gave a full account of the fight and of the
steps he had afterwards taken to prevent them from playing
a treacherous trick upon him, and of the land fight and the
arrangements made to secure the goods he found at their head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
<q>And now, what have you brought home this time?</q> the
admiral asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the list, sir. I took it from the bills of lading
which we found at the pirate head-quarters. Altogether the
storehouses contained the cargoes of eleven ships. We picked
out the most valuable goods and loaded the cutter and schooner
with them, but that was only a very small portion of the total.
I have left nearly half my crew there to guard the storehouses
until you could send some ships from here to bring home
their contents. With the cutter to navigate and the schooner
to tow I dared not weaken myself further. I have left
six<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>teen of my men there under my boatswain, and have erected
four batteries with cotton bales, each mounting two guns,
which are charged to the muzzle with grape and langrage.
I have every confidence, therefore, that the little garrison will
be able to hold its own against a greatly superior force.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was a great risk,</q> the admiral said gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am aware of that, sir, but it was worth running the risk
for such a splendid prize. The value of nearly eleven cargoes
must be something very great.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indeed it must,</q> the admiral said; <q>what are they composed
of?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will see the entire list in the bills of lading, sir. I
should say that nearly half the goods are sugar, rum, and
molasses; the other half are bales and boxes, of which the
details are given. Those we have brought home are silks,
satins, cloth, shawls, and other materials of female dress,
coffee, and spices.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Mr. Gilmore, this certainly appears to be the richest
haul that has ever been made in these islands, at any rate
since the days of the Spanish galleons. I will lose no time
in chartering some ships. How many do you think will be
necessary?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should say, sir, that if you had five vessels you could do
it in two trips. Meanwhile I wish you would give me another
thirty men to strengthen the garrison.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I will do so. There are several vessels in the
harbour which have discharged their cargoes and have not
yet taken fresh ones on board, but are waiting to sail for
England under a convoy. They will, no doubt, be glad of
a job in the meantime.</q>
</p>

<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>

<p>
Four days later the cutter again put to sea, with five
merchantmen and a frigate, which was charged to act as a
convoy. When they arrived off the inlet Will went ashore,
and to his delight found the storehouses intact, and the little
garrison all well. The crews of all the ships were at once
landed, and in a short time the place was a scene of bustle
and activity. In spite, however, of their exertions it was a
fortnight before all the ships were loaded.
</p>

<p>
Before setting sail again Will told off the thirty additional
men to remain, and Harman was left in command. Dimchurch
had reported that only once had the pirates shown in force.
He had allowed them to come within a hundred yards of the
battery they were facing, and then poured the contents of both
guns into them, whereupon they had at once fled, leaving
ten killed behind them.
</p>

<p>
When the little fleet arrived at Jamaica again, Will found
that the goods which he had brought in the cutter and schooner
were valued at a far higher price than his estimate.
</p>

<p>
The merchantmen were unloaded as fast as possible, and
started again for Cuba without delay. All was well with the
garrison at the inlet. A serious attack had been made on the
forts the day after the fleet had sailed for Jamaica, but the
garrison had repulsed it so effectually that they had not seen
a sign of the enemy since. Even the hope of plunder was not
strong enough to induce the negroes to make another attempt,
and as for the pirates, they had been almost entirely wiped out.
</p>

<p>
After the storehouses had been emptied they were burned,
and Harman and his party returned to the cutter, and the
fleet once more sailed for Jamaica.
</p>

<p>
Will immediately started again on a short cruise. This
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>time he met with no adventures. At the end of three weeks
he returned, and when he went to make his report the admiral
told him that the total value of the capture amounted to
£140,000.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must congratulate you,</q> he said, <q>as well as myself, on
this haul. I should say it would make you the richest
midshipman in the service. My share, as you know, is an
eighth. You, as officer in command, and altogether independent
of the fleet, will get one quarter. Mr. Harman’s
share will be an eighth, and the rest will be divided among
the crew, the boatswain getting four shares.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am astounded, sir,</q> Will said, <q>it seems almost impossible
that I can be master of so much money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have the satisfaction at any rate, Mr. Gilmore, of
knowing that you have earned it by your own exertions,
courage, and skill. I think now that it is only fair that
I should send you back to your ship when she next comes
in, and give someone else a chance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I agree with you, sir, and I cannot but feel deeply
indebted to you for having put me in the way of making
a fortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I little knew what was coming of it,</q> the admiral said,
<q>when I gave you the command of that little craft. If I
had had the slightest notion I should assuredly have given
it to an older officer.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will returned to the cutter in a state of bewilderment
at his good fortune. When he came on deck a little later
he found waiting for him a gentleman who advanced with
open arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Gilmore,</q> he said, <q>my name is Palethorpe. I am
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>the father of the young girl whose life you so gallantly saved
when the <name type="ship">Northumberland</name> sank. I have been trying to catch
you ever since, but I live up among the hills, except when
business calls me down here, and your stay here has always
been so short that I never before heard of your arrival until
you had started again. I cannot say, sir, how intensely grateful
I feel. She is my only child, and you may guess what a
terrible blow it would have been to me had she been lost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only did my duty, sir, and I am glad indeed that I was
able to save your daughter’s life. Pray do not say anything
more about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, my dear sir, that is quite impossible. One man
cannot render so vast a service to another and escape without
being thanked. I have driven down here to carry you off to
my home whether you like it or not. I called on the admiral
this morning, and he said that he would willingly grant you
a week’s leave or longer, and, in fact, that you would be unemployed
until the <name type="ship">Hawke</name> came in, as a master’s mate would
take over your command.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will felt that he could not decline an invitation so heartily
given. Accordingly he packed up his shore-going kit, left
Harman in temporary command, and went with his new friend
ashore. A well-appointed vehicle with a pair of fine horses
was waiting for them, and as soon as they were seated they
at once started inland. After leaving the town they began
to mount, and were soon high among the mountains. The
scenery was lovely, and Will, who had not before made an
excursion so far into the interior, was delighted with his drive.
So much so, indeed, that Mr. Palethorpe gradually ceased speaking
of the subject nearest his heart, and suffered Will to enjoy
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>the journey in silence. At last they drove up to a handsome
house which was surrounded by a broad veranda covered
with roses and other flowers. As they stopped, a girl of
fourteen ran out. Will would scarcely have recognized her.
She was now dressed in white muslin, and her hair was tied
up with blue ribbon, while a broad sash of the same colour
encircled her waist. She had now also recovered her colour,
which the shock of her adventure had driven from her cheeks,
and she looked the picture of health and happiness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, you dear boy!</q> she cried out, and to Will’s astonishment
and consternation she threw her arms round his neck
and kissed him. <q>Oh, how much you have done for us! If
it hadn’t been for you father would have had no one to pet
him and scold him. It would have been dreadful, wouldn’t
it, daddy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would indeed, my child,</q> her father said gravely; <q>it
would have taken all the joy out of my life, and left me a
lonely old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have told you before,</q> she said, <q>that you are not to
call yourself old. I don’t call you old at all; I consider that
you are just in your prime. Now come in, Mr. Gilmore, I
have all sorts of iced drinks ready for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alice and Will soon became excellent friends. She took
him over the plantations and showed him the negro cabins,
fed him with fruit until he almost fell ill, and, as he said,
treated him more like a baby than as an officer in His
Majesty’s service.
</p>

<p>
<q>The stars don’t look so bright to-night,</q> Will said, as he
stood on the veranda with Mr. Palethorpe on the last evening
of his visit.
</p>

<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>

<p>
<q>No, I have been noticing it myself, and I don’t like the
look of the weather at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No!</q> Will repeated in surprise; <q>it certainly looks as if
there was a slight mist.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that is what it looks like, but at this time of year we
don’t often have mists. I am afraid we are going to have
a hurricane; it is overdue now by nearly a month. October,
November, and the first half of December are the hurricane
months, and I fear that, as it is late, we shall have a heavy
one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have seen one since I came out, and then we were at sea
and were nearly wrecked. I saw its effects on land, however,
for we spent some weeks ashore in consequence of it. The
forest was almost levelled. I certainly should not care to see
another one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it is not a thing that anyone would wish to see a
second time. Words cannot describe how terrible they are.
I hope, however, if we have one, that it will be a light one,
but I am rather afraid of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nothing more was said on the matter till they retired to
bed, when Mr. Palethorpe said, half in fun and half in
earnest: <q>I should advise you to have your clothes handy by
your bedside, Mr. Gilmore, for you may want them quickly
and badly if a hurricane comes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will laughed to himself at the warning, but nevertheless
took the advice. He had been asleep for an hour when he
felt the whole house rock. A moment later the roof blew
bodily from over his head, and at the same time there was
a roar so terrible that he did not even hear the crash of the
falling timber. He leapt out of bed, seized his clothes, and
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>hurried down. He met Mr. Palethorpe coming from his
daughter’s room, carrying her wrapped up in her bed-clothes.
They went down together to the front door. Will turned
the handle, and the door was blown in with a force that
knocked him to the floor. He struggled to his feet again
and tried to get out, but the force of the wind was so tremendous
that for some time he could not stem it. When he
did manage to get through the doorway he saw Mr. Palethorpe
standing some distance from the house. He fought his
way towards him against the wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you not going to get into shelter?</q> he shouted in the
planter’s ear.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is safer here in the open,</q> the planter said; <q>I dare not
get below a tree, but I will put my daughter in a place where
she will be safe.</q>
</p>

<p>
Struggling along against the gale he led the way to a
small shed where the gardener’s tools were kept. It was
about six feet long and three broad, and was built of bricks.
The floor was some feet below the surface of the ground, so in
entering one had to descend a short flight of steps.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just hold my daughter on her feet,</q> the planter said,
<q>while I clear this place out.</q>
</p>

<p>
Much as he tried, Will was unable to keep the girl upright,
and after a vain effort he allowed her to sink down on her
knees and then knelt by her side. As soon as he had cleared
away the tools Mr. Palethorpe came up and carried her down
into the shed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think we are quite safe here,</q> he said; <q>the wall is
only two feet above the ground, so even this gale will not
shake us. The roof is strongly put together to keep out
<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>marauders. Now, Mr. Gilmore, there is room for us to crouch
inside; it is the only place of safety I know of, for even in
the open we might be struck by the flying branches torn from
the trees. Besides, it will be a comfort to Alice to know that
we are in safety beside her.</q>
</p>

<p>
They spoke only occasionally, for the roar of the tempest
was deafening. Every now and then they would hear a crash
as some tree yielded to the force of the hurricane. Towards
morning the gale abated, and soon after sunrise the wind
suddenly stilled. When they looked out a scene of terrible
devastation met their eyes. Some trees had been torn up by
the roots, and branches twisted from others were strewed
upon the ground everywhere. The house was a wreck; the
whole of the roof was gone, and parts of the wall had been
blown down. Inside there was utter confusion; the furniture
was scattered about in all directions, and even looking-glasses
had been torn from the walls and smashed. The planter,
however, wasted but little time in looking at the wreck.
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better go up and dress at once, Alice,</q> he said,
<q>though you will have some trouble in finding your clothes.
I have no doubt that all the loose ones are scattered about
everywhere, and that some of the things are miles away. I
will go down with Will at once to the slave-huts; I am afraid
the damage and loss of life there has been great.</q>
</p>

<p>
During his passage from the house to the shed the wind had
several times threatened to tear Will’s clothes from his arms,
but he had clung to them with might and main, and succeeded
in carrying them safely into shelter. He had therefore been
able to dress while they waited for the storm to abate. Mr.
Palethorpe had felt so sure that a hurricane was impending that
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>he had simply lain down on his bed without taking off his
clothes. Accordingly they started at once for the slave-huts.
As they had expected, the destruction there was complete.
Every hut had been blown down. The negroes, who had fled
to various places for shelter, were just returning, and Mr.
Palethorpe soon learned from them that many were missing.
He at once set all hands to remove the fallen timbers, and
after two hours’ work sixteen dead bodies were recovered, for
the most part children, and nearly as many injured. Some,
also, of those who had come in had broken limbs.
</p>

<p>
Alice came down as soon as she was dressed, and brought
a bundle of sheets, needles, and thread, and Mr. Palethorpe
took off his coat and set to work to bind and bandage the
limbs and wounds. Alice suggested that a man on horseback
should be sent down to the town for a surgeon, but her father
pointed out that it would be absolutely useless to do so, as,
judging by what they could see, the destruction wrought in
the town would be terrible. Every surgeon would have his
hands full, and certainly none would be able to spare time to
come into the country. He decided to have all the worst
cases carried down to the town and seen to there; slighter
cases he could deal with himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know much about bandaging wounds,</q> he said,
<q>but I know a little, and some of the native women are very
good at nursing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alice, aided by the negresses, tore up the linen into strips
and sewed these together to make bandages. Canes split up
formed excellent splints. Will rendered all the assistance in
his power. Now he held splints in position while Mr. Palethorpe
wound the bandages round them, and now he helped
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>to distribute among the wounded the soothing drinks that the
servants of the house brought down.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you going to do now?</q> he asked as the last
bandage had been applied.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will drive down to the town and see how things are
doing there. Peter tells me that two of my horses are killed,
but the other two seemed to have escaped without injury,
as the part of the stable in which they stood was sheltered
by a huge tree, which lost its head, but was fortunately
otherwise uninjured. You had better come down with us,
Alice; we must stop at our house in town till things are put
straight here. I will, of course, ride backwards and forwards
every day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can’t I be of some help here, father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None at all; by nightfall the slaves will have built temporary
shelters of canes and branches of trees. The overseer
is among those who were killed; he was on his way from his
house to the huts when a branch struck him on the head and
killed him on the spot. I will put Sambo in his place for
the present; he is a very reliable man, and I can trust him to
issue the stores to the negroes daily. I am afraid it will be
some time before we get the house put right again, as there
will be an immense demand for carpenters in the town. We
may feel very thankful, however, that we have got a house
there. It is a good strong one, built of stone, so we may
hope to find it intact.</q>
</p>

<p>
The carriage was brought round and they took their seats
in it. The planter ordered two strong negroes to get axes
and to stand on the steps, and when all was ready they started.
The journey was long and broken; at every few yards trees
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>had fallen across the road, and these had to be chopped through
and removed before the carriage could pass. It was therefore
late in the day before they reached the town. Will could
not help grieving at the terrible destruction wrought in the
forest. In some places acres of ground had been cleared of
the trees, in others the trunks and branches lay piled in an
inextricable chaos. All the huts and cottages they passed on
their way were in ruins, and their former inhabitants were
standing listlessly gazing at the destruction. Mr. Palethorpe
had placed in the carriage two gallon jars of spirits and a
large quantity of bread, and these he had distributed among
the forlorn inhabitants while his men were chopping a road
through the trees.
</p>

<p>
When they arrived in the town they beheld a terrible scene
of devastation. The streets occupied by the dwellings of
well-to-do inhabitants had, for the most part, escaped, but
in the suburbs, where the poorer part of the population dwelt,
the havoc was something terrible. Parties of soldiers and
sailors were hard at work here, clearing the ruins away and
bringing out the dead and injured. Will, after saying good-bye
to his friends at their door, joined one of these parties, and
until late at night laboured by torchlight. At midnight he
went to Mr. Palethorpe’s house, to which he had promised
to return, and slept till morning. Two long days were occupied
in this work, and even then there was much to be done
in the way of clearing the streets of the debris and restoring
order. Not until this was finished did Will cease from his
labours. He then drove up with Mr. Palethorpe to his estate.
They found that a great deal of progress had been made there,
and that a gang of workmen were already engaged in preparing
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>to replace the roof and to restore the house to its former condition.
The slaves were still in their temporary homes, but
with their usual light-heartedness had already recovered from
the effects of their shock and losses, and seemed as merry and
happy as usual.
</p>

<p>
On his return to Port Royal, Will was the object of the
greatest attentions on the part of the other passengers of the
<name type="ship">Northumberland</name>, and received so many invitations to dinner
that he was obliged to ask the admiral to allow him to give
up his leave and to take another short cruise in <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>,
promising that if he did so he would take good care not to
capture any more prizes. The admiral consented, and in a
few days the cutter set sail once more.
</p>

<p>
After they had been out a month Will found it necessary
to put in to get water. He chose a spot where a little stream
could be seen coming down from the mountains and losing
itself in the shingle, and he rowed ashore and set some of his
men to fill the barrels. When he saw the work fairly under
weigh he started to walk along the shore with Dimchurch and
Tom. They had gone but a short distance when a number of
negroes rushed suddenly out upon them. Will had just time
to discharge his pistols before he was knocked senseless by a
negro armed with a bludgeon. Tom and Dimchurch stood
over him and made a desperate defence, and just before they
were overpowered Dimchurch shouted at the top of his voice:
<q>Put off, we are captured,</q> for he saw that the number of
their assailants was so great that it would only be sacrificing
the crew to call them to their assistance. They were bound
and carried away by the exulting negroes.

  </else></pgIf>
<p>
<q>This is a bad job,</q> Will said when he came to his senses.
</p>

<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>

<p>
<q>A mighty bad job, Master Will. Who are these niggers,
do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose they are escaped slaves; there are certainly
many of them in the mountains of Cuba. I suppose they saw
us sailing in, and came down from the hills in the hope of
capturing some of us. It is likely enough they take us for
pirates, who are a constant scourge to them, capturing them
in their little fishing-boats and either cutting their throats or
forcing them to serve with them. I am afraid we shall have
but very little opportunity of explaining matters to them, for,
of course, they don’t speak English, and none of us understand
a word of Spanish.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were carried up the hill and thrown down in a small
clearing on the summit. Will in vain endeavoured to address
them in English, but received no attention whatever.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you think they are going to do with us, sir?</q>
Dimchurch asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I should say that they are most likely going to burn
us alive, or put us to death in some other devilish way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I don’t think these niggers know much about
tying ropes. It seems to me that I could get free without
much trouble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Could you, Dimchurch? I can’t say as much, for mine
are knotted so tightly that I cannot move a finger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That won’t matter, sir. If I can shift out of mine I have
got my jack-knife in my pocket, and can make short work of
your ropes and Tom’s.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, try then, Dimchurch. Half those fellows are away
in the wood, and by the sounds we hear they are cutting
brushwood; so there is no time to lose.</q>
</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>

<p>
For five minutes no remark was made, and then Dimchurch
said: <q>I am free.</q> Immediately afterwards Will felt his
bonds fall off, and half a minute later an exclamation of
thankfulness from Tom showed that he too had been liberated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now we must all crawl towards the edge of the forest,</q>
Will said, <q>and then, instead of going straight down the hill
we will turn off for a short distance. They are sure to miss
us immediately, and will believe that we have made direct for
the sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had barely got into the shelter of the forest when
they heard a sudden shout, so they at once turned aside and
hid in the brushwood. A minute or two later they had the
satisfaction of hearing the negroes rushing in a body down the
hill. They waited until their pursuers had covered a hundred
yards, and then they jumped to their feet and held on their
way along the hillside for nearly a quarter of a mile, after
which they began to descend. Just as they changed their
course they heard an outburst of musketry <corr sic='fire."'>fire.</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hooray!</q> Dimchurch exclaimed, <q>our fellows are coming
up the hill in search of us. That’s right, give it them hot! I
guess they’ll go back as quick as they came.</q> They now
changed their direction, taking a line that would bring them
to the rear of their friends. The firing soon ceased, the
negroes having evidently got entirely out of sight of the
sailors, but by the shouting they had no difficulty in ascertaining
the position of the party, who were pushing on up the hill,
and presently Will hailed them.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the captain’s voice,</q> one of the party exclaimed,
and then a general cheer broke from the seamen. In another
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>two minutes they were among their friends. Harman had
landed with three-and-thirty men, leaving only five on board
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name>. Great was their rejoicing on finding that the three
missing men were all safe.
</p>

<p>
<q>We had better fall back now,</q> Will said. <q>There must be
at least three hundred negroes at the top, and though I don’t
say we would not beat them we should certainly suffer some
loss which might well be avoided. There is no doubt they
took us for pirates and believed they were going to avenge
their own wrongs. So we may as well make our way down
before their whole force gathers and attacks us.</q>
</p>

<p>
They retired at once to the shore, and had but just taken
their places in the boats when a crowd of negroes rushed down
to the beach. Four or five shots were fired, but by Will’s
order no reply was made. They pushed off quietly and in a
few minutes reached the cutter.
</p>

<p>
<q>That has been a narrow escape,</q> Will said when he
and Harman were together again on the quarter-deck; <q>as
narrow as I ever wish to experience. If it hadn’t been for
Dimchurch I don’t think you would have arrived in time, for
they were cutting brushwood for a fire on which they intended
to roast us. Fortunately he was not so tightly bound as we
were, and so managed to free himself and us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot say how thankful I was when I heard your voice.
Of course we were proceeding only by guesswork, and could
only hope that we should find you at the top of the hill. If
they had carried you any farther away we could not have
followed. I was turning this over in my mind as we advanced,
when we heard the rushing of a large number of men down
the hill towards us, and we at once concluded that you had
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>escaped and that they were in pursuit, and as soon as the
negroes appeared we opened fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, all is well that ends well. It was very foolish of me
to wander away from the men. Of course there was nothing
whatever to tell us that we were being watched, but I ought
to have assumed that there was a possibility of such a thing
and not to have run the risk. I’ll be mighty careful that I
don’t play such a fool’s trick again. It was lucky that Dimchurch
shouted when he did to the watering-party, otherwise
we should have lost the whole of them, and with ten gone you
would have found it very hazardous work to land a sufficiently
strong party.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have tried if I had only had a dozen men. I
concluded that it must have been negroes who had carried
you off, and my only thought was to rescue you before they
set to work to torture you in some abominable manner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I expect it would soon have been over, Harman,
but certainly it would have been a very unpleasant ending.
To fall in battle is a death at which none would grumble,
but to be burnt by fiendish negroes would be horrible. Of
course every man must run risks and take his chances, but
one hardly bargains for being burnt alive. It makes my flesh
creep to think of it, more now, I fancy, than when I was face
to face with it. When I was lying helpless on the hill, there
seemed something unreal about it, and I could not appreciate
the position, but now that I think of it in cold blood it makes
me shiver. I will take your watch to-night; I am quite sure
that if I did get to sleep I should have a terrible nightmare.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can quite understand that you would rather be on deck
than lying down and trying to sleep. I am sure I should
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>do so myself, and even now the thought of the peril you were
in makes me shudder.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a time <name type="ship">L’Agile</name> cruised off the shore of Cuba, effecting
a few small captures, but none of importance. Finally she
fell in with three French frigates and was chased for two
days, but succeeded in giving her pursuers the slip by running
between two small islands under cover of night. The
passage was very shallow, and the Frenchmen were unable
to follow, and before they could make a circuit of the islands
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name> was out of sight. When the cutter at length returned
to Jamaica the admiral decided to lay her up for a
time, and the crew was broken up and retransferred to the
vessels to which they belonged.
</p>

<p>
Will was greeted with enthusiasm when he rejoined the
<name type="ship">Hawke</name>.
</p>

<p>
<q>You certainly have singular luck, Gilmore,</q> said Latham,
who was the <name type="ship">Hawke’s</name> master’s mate. <q>Here we have been
cruising and cruising, till we are sick of the sight of islands,
without picking up a prize of importance, while you have been
your own master, and have made a fortune. And now, just
as there is a rumour that we are to go home you rejoin.</q>
</p>

<p>
A few weeks after this conversation the <name type="ship">Hawke</name> received
orders to sail for Portsmouth, and after a long and wearisome
voyage arrived home late in the summer of the year 1793.

<head>CHAPTER X</head>

<head type="sub">BACK AT SCARCOMBE</head>

<p>
The news of their destination had created great satisfaction
among the crew, as there was little honour or prize-money
to be gained, and the vessel had been for some time incessantly
engaged in hunting for foes that were never found. Not the
least pleased was Will. He had left England a friendless
ship’s-boy; he returned home a midshipman, with a most
creditable record, and with a fortune that, when he left the
service, would enable him to live in more than comfort.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at Portsmouth the crew were at once paid off,
and Will was appointed to the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>, a thirty-four gun frigate.
On hearing the name of the ship, Dimchurch and Tom Stevens
at once volunteered. They were given a fortnight’s leave; so
Will, with Tom Stevens, determined to take a run up to Scarcombe,
and the same day took coach to London. Dimchurch
said he should spend his time in Portsmouth, as there was no
one up in the north he cared to see, especially as it would take
eight days out of his fortnight’s leave to go to his native place
and back.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day after leaving London the two travellers
reached Scarborough. Tom Stevens started at once, with his
kit on a stick, to walk to the village, while Will made enquiries
for the house of Mrs. Archer, which was Miss Warden’s
married name. Without much trouble he made his way to it;
and when the servant answered his knock he said: <q>I wish to
see Mrs. Archer.</q>
</p>

<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>

<p>
<q>What name, sir?</q> the girl said respectfully, struck with
the appearance of the tall young fellow in a naval uniform.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather not say the name,</q> Will said. <q>Please
just say that a gentleman wishes to speak to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you come this way?</q> the girl said, leading him to
a sitting-room. A minute later Mrs. Archer appeared. She
bowed and asked: <q>What can I do for you, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you do not know me, madam?</q> said Will.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him carefully. <q>I certainly do not,</q> she
said, and after a pause: <q>Why, it can’t be!—yes, it is—Willie
Gilmore!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is, madam, but no doubt changed out of all recognition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have from time to time got your letters,</q> said Mrs.
Archer, <q>and learned from them with pleasure and surprise
that you had become an officer, but never pictured you as
grown and changed in this way. I hope you have got my
letters in return?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only got one, Mrs. Archer, and it reached me just before
we sailed from the Mediterranean two years ago. I was not
surprised, however, for of course the post is extremely uncertain.
It is only very seldom that letters reach a ship on a
foreign station.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear, dear, you have lost some fingers!</q> Mrs. Archer
cried, suddenly noticing Will’s left hand. <q>How sad, to be
sure!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is quite an old story, Mrs. Archer. I lost them at
the attempt to capture St. Pierre, and am so accustomed to the
loss now that I hardly notice it. It is surprising how one can
do without a thing. I have to be thankful, indeed, that it was
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>the left hand instead of the right, as, had it been the other
way, I should probably have had to leave the navy, which
would have meant ruin to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is all very well to make light of it,</q> she said, <q>but you
must feel it a great drawback.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you see, Mrs. Archer, the loss of three fingers is of
course terrible for a sailor, who has to row, pull at ropes,
scrub decks, and do work of all sorts; but an officer does not
have to do manual work of any kind, and hardly feels such
a loss, except, perhaps, at meals. I am going to sea again
almost directly, but the first time I have a long holiday I shall
have some false fingers fitted on, more for the sake of avoiding
being stared at than for anything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am more than pleased at seeing you again, Willie.
It is so natural for me to call you that, that it will be some
time before I can get out of it. So you have got on very
well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Entirely owing to you, Mrs. Archer, as I told you in the
first letter I wrote to you after I got my promotion. You
taught me to like study, and were always ready to help me on
with my work, and it was entirely owing to my having learned
so much, especially mathematics, that I was able to attract the
attention of the officers and to get put on the quarter-deck.
I have, I am happy to say, done very well, and I am sure
of my step as soon as I have passed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had the extraordinary good fortune,</q> he said, after
chatting for some time, <q>to be put in command of a prize that
had been taken from some pirates, and was thus able to earn
a good deal of prize-money. But nothing has given me greater
pleasure since I went away than the purchasing of this little
<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>present for you as a token, though a very poor one, of my
gratitude to you for your kindness;</q> and he handed her a little
case containing a diamond brooch, for which he had paid one
hundred and fifty pounds as he came through London.
</p>

<p>
<q>Willie!</q> she exclaimed in surprise as she opened it, <q>how
could you think of buying such a valuable ornament for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have liked to buy something more valuable,</q> he
said. <q>If I had paid half my prize-money it would only have
been fair, for I should never have won it but for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have nothing nearly so valuable,</q> she said. <q>Well, now,
you must take up your abode with us while you stay here.
How long have you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a fortnight’s leave, but it has taken me four days
to come down here, and of course I shall have to allow as
many for the return journey. I have therefore six days to
spare, and I shall be very pleased indeed to stay with you. I
must, of course, spend one day going over to the village to
see John Hammond and his wife. I am happy to say that I
shall be able to make their declining days comfortable. Your
father is, I hope, well, Mrs. Archer?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is going on just as usual. I was over there a fortnight
ago. I am sure he will be very glad to see you; he
always enquires, when I go over, whether I have had a letter
from you, and takes great interest in your progress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tom Stevens has come back with me, and has gone on
to-day to the village. I told him not to mention about my
coming, as I want to take the old couple by surprise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That you certainly will do. Of course they have aged a
little since you went away, but there is no great change in
them. Ah, there is my husband’s knock! Lawrence,</q> she
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>said, as he entered, <q>this is the village lad I have so often
spoken to you about. He has completely changed in the
three years and a half he has been away. We heard, you
remember, that he had become an officer, but I was quite
unprepared for the change that has come over him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to see you, Mr. Gilmore. My wife has talked
about you so often that I quite seem to know you myself,
but, of course, as I did not know you in those days I can
hardly appreciate the change that has come over you. One
thing I can say, however, and that is that you bear no resemblance
whatever to a fisher lad.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will was soon quite at home with Mr. and Mrs. Archer,
who introduced him with pride as <q>our sailor boy</q> to many
of their friends. On the third day of his stay he hired a gig
and drove over to Scarcombe. Alighting at the one little inn,
he walked to John Hammond’s cottage, watched on the way
by many enquiring eyes, the fisher folk wondering whether
this was a new revenue officer. He knocked at the door,
lifted the latch, and entered. The old couple were sitting
at the fire, and looked in surprise at the young officer standing
at the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir,</q> John asked, <q>what can I do for you? I have
done with smuggling long ago, and you won’t find as much as
a drop of brandy in my house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So I suppose, John,</q> Will said; <q>your smuggling didn’t
do you much good, did it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I don’t see as that is any business of yours,</q> the
old man answered gruffly. <q>I don’t mind owning that I have
handled many a keg in my time, but you can’t bring that
against me now.</q>
</p>

<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>

<p>
<q>I have no intention of doing so, John. I dare say you
gave it up for good when that dirty little boy who used to
live with you chucked it and got into trouble for doing so.
You recollect me, don’t you, mother?</q> he said, as the old
woman sat staring at him with open eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it is Willie himself!</q> she exclaimed; <q>don’t you
know him, John, our boy Willie, who ran away and went to
sea?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don’t say it is Will!</q> the old man said, getting up.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is Will sure enough,</q> the lad said, holding out his
hand first to one and then to the other. <q>He has come back,
as you see, an officer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Parson told us that. Well, well! Why, it was only
two days ago that Tom Stevens came in. He has growed to
be a fine young fellow too, and he told us that you were well
and hearty and had been through lots of fights. But he didn’t
say nothing about your having come home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, here I am, John; and what is better, I have brought
home some money with me, and I shall be able to allow you
and the mother a guinea a week as long as you live.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don’t mean it, lad!</q> the old man said with a gasp of
astonishment; <q>a guinea a week! may the Lord be praised!
Do you hear that, missis? a guinea a week!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lord, Lord, only to think of it; why, we shall be downright
rich!</q> said his wife. <q>Plenty of sugar and tea, a bit of
meat when we fancy it, and a drop of rum to warm our old
bones on Saturday night. It is wonderful, John. The Lord
be praised for His mercies! But can you afford it, Will? We
wouldn’t take it from you if you can’t, not for ever so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can afford it very well,</q> Will said, <q>and it will give me
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>more pleasure to give it you than to spend it in any other
way. Now, mother, let us say no more about it. Here is a
guinea as a start, and I wish you would go to the shop and
get some tea and sugar and bread and butter and a nice piece
of bacon, and let us have a meal just as we used to do when
we had made a good haul, or taken a hand in a successful
run.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is three years and a half since I saw a golden guinea,</q>
the old woman said as she put on her bonnet, <q>and they won’t
believe their eyes at the shop when I go in with it. You
are sure you would like tea better than beer?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Much better, though if John would prefer beer, get it for
him; but I think we had better put that off till this evening,
then we will have a glass of something hot together before I
start.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not going away so soon as that, Will, surely?</q>
the old man said when his wife had left them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, John, this is a short visit. I have only four days,
and am staying with Miss Warden; that is to say, Miss
Warden that was. I must go in and see her father for a few
minutes. We’ll have plenty of time to talk over everything
before I leave, which I won’t do till eight o’clock. I don’t
suppose you have much to tell me, for there are not many
changes in a place like this. This man, perhaps, has lost his
boat, and that one his life, but that is about all. Now I have
gone through a big lot, and have many adventures to tell
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how did you come to be made an officer, Will? That
is what beats me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Entirely owing to my work at books, which you used
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>always to be raging about. But for that I should have
remained before the mast all my life. Now in a couple of
years or so I’ll be a lieutenant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well! one never knows how things will turn out.
I did think you were wasting your time in reading, and
reading, and reading. I didn’t see what good so much book-learning
would do you; but if it got you made an officer, there
is no doubt that you were right and I was wrong. But you
see, lad, I was never taught any better.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It has all turned out right, John, and there is no occasion
for you to worry over the past. I felt sure that it would do
me good some day, so I stuck to it in spite of your scolding,
and you will allow that I was never backward in turning out
when you wanted me for the boat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will allow that, Will, allow it hearty; for there was no
better boy in the village. And so you have been fighting,
I suppose, just like Tom Stevens.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just the same, father. We have been together all the
time, and we have come back together.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he didn’t say a word about it!</q> the old man said.
<q>He talked about you just as if you were somewhere over the
sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told him not to tell,</q> Will said, <q>as I wanted to take
you by surprise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he is not an officer, Will. He is just a sailor like those
revenue men. How does that come about? Didn’t he fight
well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, no one could fight better. If he had had as much
learning as I had he would have been made an officer too; but,
you see, he can hardly read or write, and, fight as he may, he
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>will always remain as he is. A finer fellow never stepped;
but because he has no learning he must always remain before
the mast.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you have lost some fingers I see, Will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, they were shot off by a musket-ball in the West
Indies. Luckily it was my left hand; so I manage very well
without them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope you blew off the fingers of the fellow that shot
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I can’t say who did it, and indeed I never felt anything
at all until some little time after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish I had been there,</q> John said, <q>I would have had
a slap at him with a musket. That was an unlucky shot, Will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I have always considered it a lucky one, for if it
had gone a few inches on one side it would have probably
finished me altogether.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well, it is wonderful to me. Here am I, an old man,
and never, so far as I can remember, been a couple of miles
from Scarcombe, and you, quite a young chap, have been
wandering and fighting all over the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not quite so much as that, John, though I have certainly
seen a good deal. But here is mother.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hammond entered with a face beaming with delight.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">You never saw anyone so astonished as Mrs. Smith when
I went in and ordered all those things. Her eyes opened
wider and wider as I went on, and when I offered her the gold
I thought she would have a fit. She took it and bit it to
make sure that it was good, and then said: <q>Have you found
it, Mrs. Hammond, or what good fortune have you <corr sic="extra double quote">had?</corr></q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none"><q><corr sic="missing single quote">The</corr> best of fortunes, Mrs. 
    <corr sic="double quote instead of single quote">Smith,</corr></q> says I. 
    <q><corr sic="double quote instead of single quote">My</corr> boy
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>Will has come back from the wars a grand officer, with his
pocket lined with gold, so you will find I’ll be a better customer
to you than I have <corr sic="double quote instead of single quote">been.</corr></q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>You don’t say so, Mrs. Hammond!</q> says she. <q>I always
thought he was a nice boy, well spoken and civil. And so he
is an officer, is he? Only to think of it! Well, I am mighty
pleased to hear it,</q> and with that I came off with my basket
full of provisions. The whole village will be talking of it
before nightfall. Mrs. Smith is a good soul, but she is an
arrant gossip, and you may be sure that the tale will gain by
the telling, and before night people will believe that you have
become one of the royal family.</q>
</p>

<p>
In half an hour a meal was ready—tea, crisp slices of fried
bacon, and some boiled eggs—and never did three people sit
down to table in a more delighted state of mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>My life,</q> the old woman said, when at last the meal was
finished, <q>just to think that we’ll be able to feed every day of
the year like this! Why, we’ll grow quite young again, John;
we sha’n’t know ourselves. We had five shillings a week
before, and now we’ll have six-and-twenty. I don’t know
what we’ll do with it. Why, we didn’t get that on an average,
not when you were a young man and as good a fisherman as
there was in the village. We did get more sometimes when
you made a great haul, or when a cargo was run, but then,
more often, when times were bad, we had to live on fish for
weeks together.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, missis, clear away the things and reach me down
my pipe from the mantel, and we’ll hear Will’s tales. I’ll
warrant me they will be worth listening to.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the table was cleared the old woman put some more
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>coal on the fire and they sat round it, the old folk one on
each side, with Will in the middle. Then Will told his adventures,
the fight with the French frigate, the battle with
the three Moorish pirates, how he had had the luck to save
the first lieutenant’s life and so obtained his promotion, and
how the next prize they took was recaptured, but that he
and a portion of the crew again overcame the Moors. Then
he related how he had had the good fortune to obtain the
command of a prize, with forty men and another midshipman
under him, and gave a vivid account of the adventures he
had gone through while cruising about in her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well!</q> John Hammond said, when he brought his
story to a conclusion, <q>you have had goings-on. To think
that a boy like you should command a vessel and forty men,
and should take three pirates.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the most awful part of it all,</q> the old woman said, <q>is
about them black negroes that carried you off and were going
to burn you alive. Lor’, I’ll dream of it at nights.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope not, missis,</q> John said. <q>You dream more than
enough now, and wake me up with your jumps and starts,
and give me a lot of trouble to pacify you and convince you
that you have only been dreaming. I am sorry, Will, that
you told us about those niggers. I know I’ll have lots of
trouble over it. Generally all she has had to dream about
has been that my boat was sinking, or that the revenue officers
had taken me and were going to hang me; but that will be
nothing to this ’ere negro business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are terrible creatures these negroes, ain’t they?</q> the
old woman said. <q>I have heard tell that they have horns
and hoofs like the devil.</q>
</p>

<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>

<p>
<q>No, no, mother, they are not so bad as that, and they don’t
have tails, either. They are not good-looking men for all that,
and they look specially ugly when they are gathering firewood
to make a bonfire of you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For goodness sake don’t say more about them; it makes
me all come over in a sweat to think about them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Just at this moment Tom Stevens came in and sat and
chatted for some time. Will asked him to come in again
later and to bring with him a bottle of the best spirits he
could find in the village.
</p>

<p>
<q>I’ll warrant I will get some good stuff,</q> Tom said. <q>There
are plenty of kegs of the best hidden away in the village, and
I think I know where to lay my hand on one of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will then went to the rectory and had a chat with Mr.
Warden, who was unaffectedly glad to see him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I never quite approved,</q> he said, <q>of my daughter’s hobby
of educating you, but I now see that she was perfectly right.
I thought myself that at best you would obtain some small
clerkship, and that your life would be a happier one as a
fisherman. It has, however, turned out admirably well, and
she has a right to be proud of her pupil. After the way you
have begun there is nothing in your own line to which you
may not attain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wanted to ask you, Mr. Warden, what you could remember
about my father. My own recollection of him is
very dim. I am going to sea again in a week, but next time
I return I’ll have a longer spell on shore, and I am resolved
to make an effort to discover who he was.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I fear that is quite hopeless, but I will certainly tell you
all I know about him. I saw him, of course, many times in
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>the village. He was a tall thin man with what I might call a
devil-may-care, and at the same time a mournful expression.
I have no doubt that had his death not been so sudden he would
have told you something about himself. I have his effects
tied up in a bundle. I examined them at the time, but there
was nothing of any value in them except a signet-ring. It
bore a coat-of-arms with a falcon at the top. I intended to
hand this to you when you grew up, but of course you left so
suddenly that I had no opportunity to do so. I will give you
the bundle now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much, sir! That ring may be the means
of discovering my identity. Of course I have no time to make
enquiries now, but when I next return I will advertise largely
and offer a reward for information. It is not that I want to
thrust myself on any family, or to raise any claim, but I should
like, for my own satisfaction, to know that I come of a
decent family.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is very natural,</q> the clergyman said; <q>but were I
you I should not hope to be successful. You see, nearly
thirteen years have elapsed since his death, and he may have
been wandering about for three or four years before. That
is a long time to elapse before making any enquiries.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That may be so, but if these arms belong, as I suppose,
to a good family, there must be others bearing them, and an
advertisement of a lost member of it might at once catch
their eye, and might very possibly bring a reply. Besides,
surely there must be some place where a record is kept of
these things.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know that, but I am sure I wish you success in
your search, and can well understand that, now you are an
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>officer in His Majesty’s navy, you would like to claim relationship
with some big family.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, sir. Of course I cannot imagine how it was my
father came to be in such reduced circumstances.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should say, Will, that he quarrelled with his father, perhaps
over his marriage, and left home in a passion. He was
a man who, I could well imagine, when he once quarrelled,
would not be likely to take the first step to make it up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps that was it, sir. Well, I am exceedingly obliged
to you, and will, you may be sure, investigate the contents of
the bundle carefully.</q>
</p>

<p>
Returning to the cottage, Will found Tom Stevens already
there with a small keg of brandy.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is good stuff, Will,</q> he said; <q>it has been lying hidden
for eight years, and was some of the choicest landed. I got it
as a favour, and had to pay pretty high for it; but I knew you
would not stick at the price.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly not, I wanted the best that could be got. Now,
mother, mix us three good stiff tumblers, and take a glass for
yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is twenty year since I tasted spirits,</q> the old woman
said, <q>though John has often got a drop after a successful
run; but this afternoon I don’t mind if I do try a little, if
it is only to put the thought of them bonfiring negroes out of
my mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope it will have that effect,</q> Will laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, John, I told you about my adventures; let me hear
a little village gossip.</q>
</p>

<p>
John’s tale was not a very long, nor, it must be owned, a very
interesting one. Mary Johnson, Elizabeth Cruikshank, Mary
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>Leaper, and Susie Thurston had all had boys, while there had
been five girls born. It was not necessary, however, to specify
the names of their mothers, as girls were considered quite
secondary persons in Scarcombe. One small cargo had been
run, but the revenue people were so sharp that the French
lugger had given up making the village a landing-place.
John Mugby and his two sons had been drowned, and John
Hawkins’s boat had been smashed up. As a result of the
decline of smuggling there had been a revulsion of the feeling
against Will, and the four men who had been the ringleaders
in the movement had made themselves so generally obnoxious
that they had had to leave the village.
</p>

<p>
At seven o’clock Will said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, father, I must be moving. Here are fifty guineas.
They will last you for nearly a year. I’ll hand another fifty
to Mr. Archer, and ask him to send you twenty pounds at a
time. I’ll probably be back in England before it has all gone,
and if not I will manage to find a means of sending more over
to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I sha’n’t sleep,</q> the old woman said; <q>I never shall sleep
with all that money in the house. It is sure to get known
about, and I should never feel safe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, mother, take the money up to Mr. Warden,
and ask him to hand you a guinea every Monday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tom Stevens,</q> said the old woman, <q>I will ask you to go
up to the rectory with me this very evening. I daren’t keep
it here, and I daren’t carry it through the village, for there
might be a pedlar about, and everybody knows that pedlars
are apt to be thieves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well,</q> Tom said with a smile, <q>I will go with you,
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>missis, when Will has left. I am big enough to tackle a pedlar
if we meet one on the way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very heartily, Tom! I’ll be comfortable now;
but I should never get a wink of sleep with fifty gold guineas
in the house.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will had noticed that the old couple’s clothes were sorely
patched, and the next morning he purchased a complete
new outfit for both. These he sent over by a carrier, with a
note, saying: <q>My dear father, it is only right that you should
start with a fair outfit, and I therefore send you and the missis
a supply that will last you for some time.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tom Stevens came over two days later, and he and Will
started together for London. On their arrival at Portsmouth
they at once joined the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>, which was quite ready to sail,
and which was under orders to join Lord Hood’s fleet in the
Mediterranean.
</p>
</div><div n="11">
    <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI</head>

<head type="sub">CAPTIVES AMONG THE MOORS</head>

<p>
A week later the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> proceeded to the Mediterranean.
One morning after cruising there for some weeks, when
the light mist lifted, a vessel was seen some three miles away.
The captain looked at her through his telescope.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a suspicious-looking craft,</q> he said to the first
lieutenant, Mr. Roberts. <q>We will lower a cutter and overhaul
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
The cutter’s crew were at once mustered. Will was the
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>midshipman in charge of her, and took his place by the side
of the third lieutenant, Mr. Saxton. The lieutenant ordered
the men to take their muskets with them.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I take Dimchurch and Stevens?</q> Will asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, if you like. There is room for them in the bow,
and two extra muskets may be useful.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two men, who were standing close by, took their places
when they heard the permission given.
</p>

<p>
<q>I certainly don’t like her appearance, Gilmore,</q> the lieutenant
said. <q>I cannot help thinking that she is an Algerine
by her rig; and though every Algerine is not necessarily
a pirate, a very large number of them are. I fancy
a breeze will spring up soon, and in that case we may have
a long row before we overtake her.</q>
</p>

<p>
The breeze came presently, and the Algerine began to slip
away. It was, however, but a puff, and the boat again began
to gain on her. When they were five miles from the ship
they were within a quarter of a mile from the chase.
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound the fellow!</q> the lieutenant muttered; <q>but I
think I was mistaken, for there are not more than half a dozen
men on her deck.</q>
</p>

<p>
At length the boat swept up to the side of the craft. As the
men leapt to their feet a couple of round shot were thrown into
the boat, one of them going through the bottom. The cutter
immediately began to fill, and the men as they climbed up
were confronted by fully a hundred armed Moors. Lieutenant
Saxton was at once cut down, and most of the sailors
suffered the same fate. As usual, Will, Dimchurch, and
Stevens held together and fought back to back. The contest,
however, was too uneven to last, and the Moorish captain
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>came up to them and signed to them that they must lay down
their arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do it at once,</q> Will said. <q>They evidently prefer to
take us prisoners to killing us, which they could do without
difficulty. We have been caught in a regular trap, and must
make the best of <corr sic="no quote">it.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
So saying he threw down his cutlass, and the others followed
his example.
</p>

<p>
They were taken down below with three other unwounded
sailors, and the wounded and dead were at once thrown overboard.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the worst affair we have been in together,</q> said
Dimchurch, <q>since we fell into the hands of those negroes.
Unless the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> overtakes us I am afraid we are in for a
bad time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid so, Dimchurch, and I fear that there is little
chance indeed of the frigate overtaking us. In such a light
wind this craft would run away from her, and with fully five
miles start it would be useless for the boats to try to overtake
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are they going to do with us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is very little doubt about that. They will make
slaves of us, and either set us to work on the fortifications
or sell us to be taken up-country.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t expect they will keep us long,</q> Dimchurch said
grimly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know; they have great numbers of Christians
whom they hold captive, and it is rare indeed that one of
them escapes. I suppose some day or other we’ll send a fleet
to root them out, but our hands are far too full for anything
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>of that sort at present. If we have a chance of escape you
may be sure that we’ll take it, but we had better make up
our minds at once to make the best of things until opportunity
offers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only hope we’ll be kept together, sir. I could put up
with it if that were so, but it would be awful if we were separated;
for even if one saw a chance for escape he could not let
the others know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may be sure, Dimchurch, that whatever opportunity
I might see I would not avail myself of it unless I could take
you both off with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The same here, sir,</q> Dimchurch said; and the words were
echoed by Tom.
</p>

<p>
Six days later they heard the anchor run down, and presently
the hatchway was lifted and they were told to come
on deck. They found, as they had expected, that the craft
was lying in the harbour of Algiers. At any other time they
might have admired the city, with its mosques and minarets,
its massive fortifications, and the shipping in the port, but
they were in no humour to do so now. They regarded it
as their jail. They and the three sailors were put into a
boat and rowed ashore, the captain of the craft going with
them. They were met at the wharf by a Moor, who was
evidently an official of rank. He and the captain held an
animated conversation, and by their laughter Will had no
doubt whatever that the captain was telling the clever manner
in which he had effected their capture. Then the official said
something which was not altogether pleasing to the captain,
who, however, crossed his hands on his breast and bowed
submissively. The official then handed the six prisoners over
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>to some men who had accompanied him, and they were immediately
marched across to a large barrack-like building,
which was evidently a prison. Two hours afterwards a great
troop of captives came in. These were so worn and wearied
that they asked but few questions of the new-comers.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t talk about it,</q> one said in answer to a question
from Will. <q>There is not one of us who would not kill himself
if he got the chance. It is work, work, work from daybreak
till sunset. We have enough to eat to keep us alive;
we are too valuable to be allowed to die. We get food before
we start in the morning, again at mid-day, and again when
we get back here. Oh, they are very careful of us, but they
don’t mind how we suffer! The sun blazes down all day, and
not a drop of drink do we get except at meals. In spite of
their care we slip through their hands. Sunstroke and fever
are always thinning our ranks. That is the history of it,
mate, and if I were to talk till morning I could not tell you
more. I suppose by your cut that you are a man-of-war’s-man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You’re right,</q> Dimchurch said. <q>We got caught in a
trap, and our nine mates were killed without having a chance
to fire a shot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah!</q> the man said with a sigh, <q>I wish I had had their
luck, and you will wish so too before you have been here
long.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rough food was served out, and then the slaves, after
eating, lay down without exchanging a word, anxious only
to sleep away the thought of their misery. The three friends
lay down together. To each prisoner a small rug had been
served out, and this was their only bedding.
</p>

<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>

<p>
<q>We are certainly in a bad corner,</q> Dimchurch said, <q>but
the great point will be to keep up our spirits and make the
best of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so,</q> Will agreed. <q rend="post: none">I am convinced that, however
sharp a watch they may keep, three resolute men will find
some way of escape. We’ll know a little more about it to-morrow.
If there are windows to this building we ought to
be able to get out of them, and if it is surrounded by walls we
ought to be able to scale them. Besides, if we are set to work
in the city we might find an opportunity of evading the diligence
of our guards. For one thing, we must assume an air
of cheerfulness while we work. In time, when they see that
we do our work well and are contented and obedient, their
watch will relax. Above all, we must not, like these poor
fellows, make up our minds that our lot is hopeless. If we
once lose hope we shall lose everything. At any rate, for the
present we must wait patiently. We have still got to find
out everything; all we know is that we are confined in a
prison, and that we shall have to do some work or other
during the day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have got to find out the plan of the city and its
general bearings, to learn something, if we can, of the surrounding
country, and to see how we should manage to
subsist if we got away. Of course the natural idea would
be to make for the sea and steal a boat. But we came up
from the shore through an archway in the wall; it was
strongly guarded, and I fear it would be next to impossible
to get down to the port. Our best plan, I think, would be
to take to the country if we can, and go down to the shore
some distance from the city. We might then light upon
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>a boat belonging to some fisherman. Of course all this is
pure conjecture, and all we can arrange is that we shall
keep our eyes about us, and look for an empty house in
which we might hide and discover how we might leave the
town on the land side, where it is not likely the fortifications
will be nearly so strong as on the sea-face.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning the captives were deprived of their
clothes, and in their place were given dirty linen jackets
and loose trousers. Their shoes were also taken away.
They then fell in with the rest of the captives. On leaving
the prison they were formed into companies, each of which,
under a strong guard, marched off in different directions.
The three friends kept close together, and were assigned to
a company which was told off to clean the streets of a certain
quarter of the town. They were furnished with brooms and
brushes, and were soon hard at work. As the morning went
on, the heat became tremendous. Several men fell, but the
overseers lashed them until they got upon their feet again.
</p>

<p>
<q>My eye! this is like working in an oven,</q> Dimchurch
muttered; <q>the dust is choking me. We must certainly get
out of this as soon as we can, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I agree with you, Dimchurch. I feel as if I were melting
away. If I were to put a bit of food in my mouth I believe
the heat would bake it in no time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I couldn’t swallow anything,</q> Tom said, <q>not even a mackerel
fresh out of the sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know we agreed that we must make the best of
everything,</q> Will said. <q>If we work as we are doing we
can’t but please our overseers, and shall save ourselves from
blows.</q>
</p>

<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>

<p>
<q>They had better not strike me,</q> Dimchurch said; <q>the
man that did it would never live to strike another.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That might be,</q> Will said, <q>but it would be a small
satisfaction to you if you were to be flogged to death afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I suppose not, sir; but flesh and blood can’t stand
such a thing as being struck by one of these yellow hounds.</q>
</p>

<p>
At twelve o’clock the gang returned, and the men drank
eagerly from a fountain in the courtyard of the prison.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take as little as you can,</q> Will said; <q>if you drink much
it will do you harm. You can drink often if you like, provided
that you only take a sip at a time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is easy to say, Mr. Gilmore, but it is not so easy to
do. I feel as if I could drink till I burst.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say you do; I feel the same myself; but I am sure
that to take a lot of water just now would do us harm instead
of good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Their abstinence so far benefited them that they felt their
work in the afternoon less than they had done in the morning,
though the heat was, if anything, greater.
</p>

<p>
That evening they examined their prison. It consisted of
one great hall supported by rows of pillars. Here the whole
of the prisoners were confined. It was lighted by windows
five-and-twenty feet from the ground. There was no guard
inside, but fifty men, some of whom were always on sentry,
slept outside the hall. It was clear to them, therefore, that
no escape could be made after they were once locked up,
and that if they were to get away at all they must make the
attempt when they were employed outside.
</p>

<p>
On the third day one of the sailors from the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>, who
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>had disregarded Will’s advice to drink sparingly, fell down
dead after drinking till he could drink no more. Scarcely a
day passed without one or more of the captives succumbing;
some of them went mad and were at once despatched by their
guards.
</p>

<p>
After working for a fortnight in the streets the gang were
marched in another direction, and were put to labour on the
fortifications. This was a great relief. They were now free
from the choking dust of the streets, and obtained a view of
the surrounding country. The three, as usual, laboured
together, and showed so much zeal and activity that they
pleased the head of their guard. They had the great advantage
that they were accustomed to work together, while the
majority of the gang had no such experience. There were
men of all nationalities—French, Spanish, Italians, Maltese,
and Greeks, and though most of them were accustomed to a
warm climate, they had nothing like the strength of the three
Englishmen. In moving heavy stones, therefore, the three
friends were able to perform as much work as any dozen
other prisoners. They were the only Englishmen in the
gang, for the other two sailors had been from the first placed
with another party.
</p>

<p>
On the march to their work they passed by a palace of
considerable extent, surrounded by grounds which were entered
on that side by a small postern gate. <q>I would give a good
deal to know if that gate is locked,</q> Will said.
</p>

<p>
<q>What good would that do, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if we could get in there we might hide in the shrubbery,
and stop there till the first pursuit was over. No one
would think of searching there. I should say we might, if we
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>had luck, seize and bind three of the gardeners or attendants,
and so issue from one of the gates dressed in their clothes
without exciting suspicion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should we do for grub, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, for that we must trust to chance. There are houses
that might be robbed, and travellers who might be lightened
of their belongings. I can’t think that three active men,
though they might be unarmed, would allow themselves to
starve. Of course we should want to get rid of these clothes,
and find some weapons; but the great point of all is to discover
whether that door is locked.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, sir! I am ready to try anything you may suggest,
for I am sick to death of this work, and the heat, and the
food, and the guard, and everything connected with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
They looked at the door with longing eyes each time they
passed it. At last one day a man came out of the gateway
just as they were passing, and, pulling the gate to behind
him, walked away without apparently thinking of locking it.
</p>

<p>
<q>That settles that point,</q> Will said. <q>The next most
important question is, Are there people moving about inside?
Then how are we to slip away unseen? To begin with, we
will manage always to walk in the rear of the gang. There
are often rows; if some poor wretch goes mad and attacks
the guard there is generally a rush of the others to his assistance.
If such a thing were to happen near this gate we
might manage to slip in unnoticed. Still, I admit the chances
are against anything of the sort taking place just at that
point, and I expect we must try and think of something
better.</q>
</p>

<p>
A fortnight later, just as they were passing the door, a
<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>small party of cavalry, evidently the escort to some great
chief, came dashing along at full speed. The road being
somewhat narrow the slaves and guards scattered in all
directions, several of them being knocked down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now is our chance!</q> Will exclaimed; and the three ran to
the gate and entered the garden. There was no one in sight;
evening was coming on, and any men who might have been
working in the garden had left. They closed the gate behind
them and turned the key in the lock, then ran into a shrubbery
and threw themselves down. They trusted that in the
confusion their absence would not be noticed, and this seemed
to be the case, for they heard loud orders given and then all
was quiet.
</p>

<p>
<q>So far so good,</q> Will said. <q>The first step is taken, and
the most difficult one. To-morrow, when the gardeners come,
we will spring upon three of them and bind them. I should
not think that there will be more than that.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fortune favoured them, however, for an hour later three
servants came along, laughing and talking together. The
sailors prepared to act, and as the men passed their hiding-place
Will gave the word, and, leaping out upon them, they
hurled them to the ground. Tom and Dimchurch both
stunned their men, and then aided Will to secure the one
he had knocked down. Without ceremony they stripped off
the clothes of the fallen men, tore up their own rags, and
bound the captives securely, shoving a ball of the material
between the teeth of each, and then secured them to three
trees a short distance apart.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good,</q> said Will, as they put on the servants’
clothes; <q>they are safe till they are found in the morning.
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>In these clothes we can boldly venture out from the town
gate as soon as it is opened. There is always the risk that
our colour may betray us, but we are all burnt nearly as
dark as mahogany and may very well pass.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shall we start now, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, they will find out when they get to the prison that
we are missing, and there will be a keen hunt for us. And
now I come to think of it, the guards at the gate will be
warned of our escape, and will probably question us, particularly
as these bright-coloured garments would attract their
attention. I really think our best plan would be to go out
into the town at once and try to get hold of other disguises.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be a good thing if we could do so, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear me, how stupid I am!</q> exclaimed Will after a pause.
<q>You know that wall we were repairing to-day? It was only
about fourteen feet above the ground outside, so we should
have no difficulty in dropping down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, sir. It is an easy drop, and by leaving in that
way we’ll avoid being questioned, and get well away before
the alarm is given.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then we will lose no time,</q> said Will. <q>We have to
pass through a busy quarter, but if we go separately we shall
attract no notice, though no doubt by this time the search will
have begun. They will be looking, however, for three men
together. Of course they will not so much as cast an eye
upon the servants of this palace, for they will know nothing
of our doings here till to-morrow morning. I will go first
when we get into the street. You, Dimchurch, follow me forty
or fifty yards behind, and Tom the same distance behind you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hardly think they will be in search of us yet,</q>
Dim<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>church said. <q>It is little more than an hour since we
escaped, and they won’t find out till they get to the prison
and count the gang. When they have done that they would
have to see who it was that was missing, and then they would
take some time to organize the <corr sic="no quote">search.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, Dimchurch; still, we will take every precaution.</q>
</p>

<p>
So saying they started. When they were half-way to the
wall they saw a number of soldiers and convict guards come
running along, questioning many people as they passed. They
trembled lest they should be discovered, but fortunately no
question was put to any of them, and they kept on their way.
Presently Will emerged upon the open space of ground between
the wall and the houses, and when Dimchurch and Tom
had come up they went together along the foot of the wall
until they came to the place where they had been working.
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep your eyes open,</q> Will said as they climbed up,
<q>there are crowbars and hammers lying about, and, where the
stone-cutters were working, chisels. A crowbar or a heavy
hammer is a weapon not to be despised.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes each was armed with a chisel and a light
crowbar. They then went to the edge of the wall, and, throwing
these weapons down, lowered themselves as far as they
could reach and dropped to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God we are out of that place!</q> Will said fervently;
<q>we won’t enter it again alive. Now, the first thing is to get
as far away as possible, keeping as nearly parallel to the line
of the coast as we can, but four or five miles back, for we
may be sure that when they cannot find us in the town they
will suspect that we have made for the coast, and a dozen
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>horsemen will be sent out to look for us along the shore.
It is no use our thinking of trying to get to sea until the
search has been given up. Our principal difficulty will be
to live. From the walls the country looked well cultivated
in parts, and even if we have to exist on raw grain we shall
not be much worse off than when we were in <corr sic="no quote">prison.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t care what it is,</q> Tom said, <q>so long as there is
enough of it to keep us alive; but we must have water.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t think there will be much difficulty about that,
Tom, as every one of the houses scattered over the plain
will have wells and fountains in their gardens. Thank goodness,
they won’t miss any we take, and we could go every
night and fetch water without exciting any suspicion that we
had been there!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One of the first things we must do,</q> said Will, <q>is to
dirty these white jackets and trousers so that we may look
like field labourers, for then if anyone should catch sight of us
in the distance we should attract no attention.</q>
</p>

<p>
They walked all night, and just as morning was breaking
they saw a large country house with the usual garden. They
climbed over the wall, which was not high, and drew some
water in a bucket which they found standing at the mouth of
the well.
</p>

<p>
<q>This bucket we will confiscate,</q> Will said; <q>we can hardly
lie hidden all day without having a drink. Of course they
will miss it; but when they cannot find it they will suppose
that it has been mislaid or stolen. One of the gardeners will
probably get the blame, but we can’t help that. Now we
will go another mile and then look for a hiding-place. There
are a lot of sand-hills scattered about, and if we can’t find
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>a hole that will suit us we must scoop one out. I believe
they are pretty hard inside, but our crowbars will soon make
a place large enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
After an hour’s walk they fixed upon a spot on the shady
side of a hill and began to make a cave that would allow the
three to lie side by side. The work was completed in less
than an hour, and they crawled in and scraped up some of
the fallen sand so as partially to close the mouth behind them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank goodness, we have got shelter and water!</q> Will
said. <q>As for food, we must forage for it to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am quite content to go without it for to-day,</q> Dimchurch
said, <q>and to lie here and sleep and do nothing. I
don’t think anything would tempt me to get up and walk a
mile farther, not even the prospects of a good dinner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, as we are all so tired we shall probably sleep till
evening.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes all were asleep. Once or twice in the
course of the day they woke up and took a drink from the
bucket and then fell off again. At sunset all sat up quite
refreshed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I begin to feel that I have an appetite,</q> Will said; <q>now
I think, for to-night, we will content ourselves with going
into one of the fields and plucking a lot of the ears of maize.
Messages may have been sent out all over the country, and
the people may be watchful. It will be wise to avoid all risk
of discovery. We can gather a few sticks and make a fire in
there to roast the maize; there are sand-hills all round, so
what little flame we make would not be <corr sic="noticed.'">noticed.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how about a light?</q> Dimchurch asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I picked up a piece of flint as we came along this
morn<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>ing,</q> Will said, <q>and by means of one of these chisels we
ought to be able to strike a light; a few dead leaves, finely
crumbled up, should do instead of tinder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a good thing to keep one’s eyes open,</q> Dimchurch
remarked. <q>Now if I had seen that piece of stone I should
not have given it a thought, and here it is going to give us a
hot dinner!</q>
</p>

<p>
As there were numbers of fields in the neighbourhood they
soon returned with an armful of maize each. Dried weeds
and sticks were then collected, and after repeated failures a
light was at last obtained, and soon the grain was roasted. A
jacket was stretched across the entrance of their den so that,
should anyone be passing near, they would not observe the light.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> Will said as they munched some maize the next
evening, <q>we must start foraging. We will go in opposite
directions, and each must take his bearing accurately or we’ll
never come together again.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were out for some hours, and when they returned it
was found that Will had come across four fowls, Tom had
gathered a variety of fruit, consisting chiefly of melons and
peaches, while Dimchurch, who was the last to come in,
brought a small sheep.
</p>

<p>
<q>We only want one thing to make us perfect,</q> Will said,
<q>and that is a pipe of ’bacca.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that would be a welcome addition,</q> Tom admitted,
<q>but it does not do to expect too much. I should not be at
all surprised if we were to light upon some tobacco plants in
one of the gardens, but of course it could hardly be like a
properly dried leaf. I dare say, though, we could make something
of it.</q>
</p>

<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>

<p>
So they lived for a month, sometimes better, sometimes
worse, but with sufficient food of one sort or another. So far
as they knew no suspicion of their presence had been excited,
though their petty robberies must have been noticed. One evening,
however, Will, on going to the top of the sand-hill, as he
generally did, saw a large detachment of soldiers coming along,
searching the ground carefully. He ran down at once to his
companions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take your weapons, lads,</q> he said, <q>and make off; a
strong party of soldiers are searching the country, and they
are coming this way. No doubt they are looking for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had run but a few hundred yards when they heard
shouts, and, looking round, they saw a Moorish officer waving
his hands and gesticulating. This was alarming, but they
reckoned that they had fully five hundred yards start.
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep up a steady pace,</q> Will said; <q>I don’t expect the
beggars can run faster than we can. It will be pitch dark in
half an hour, and as, fortunately, there is no moon, I expect
we’ll be able to give them the slip.</q>
</p>

<p>
As they advanced they found that the vegetation became
scarcer and scarcer.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid we are on the edge of a desert,</q> Will said,
<q>which means that there are no more fowls and fruit for us.
I see, Dimchurch, that you have been the most thoughtful this
time. That half sheep and those cakes will be very valuable
to us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn’t going to leave them for the soldiers if I knew it,
sir; they wouldn’t have gone far among them, while they will
last us some time with care.</q>
</p>

<p>
They changed their course several times as soon as it
<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>became quite dark, and presently had the satisfaction of
hearing the shouts of their pursuers fade away behind them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now we can take it quietly, lads. We can guide ourselves
towards the sea by means of the stars. I fancy it
must be fully twenty miles away. We must hold on till we
get to it, and then gradually work our way along among
the sand-hills or clumps of bush bordering it till we come
to a village. Then we must contrive to get a good supply of
food and water, steal a boat, and make off. If galleys were
sent out to search for us they must have given it up long ago.
As for other craft, we’ll have to take our chance with them.</q>
</p>

<p>
They kept steadily north and at last came down to the
coast. As it was still dark they lay down till morning. When
the sun rose they thought they could make out a village some
eight miles away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now it will be quite safe to cook our breakfast,</q> Dimchurch
said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I think so,</q> Will answered, <q>but we must be sparing
with the mutton; that is our only food at present, and it may
be some little time before we get hold of anything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
After breakfast they lay down among the bushes and slept
till evening. Then they started along the shore towards the
village. When they got within half a mile of it they halted.
They could see some boats on the shore, so they felt that the
only difficulty in their way was the question of provisions.
When it was quite dark they went into the village and started
to forage, but on meeting again they had very little to show.
Between them they had managed to take five fowls; but the
village was evidently a poor place, for with the exception of a
few melons there was no fruit.
</p>

<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>

<p>
<q>The beggars must have grain somewhere,</q> said Will.
<q>They can’t live on fowls and melons.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expect, sir, they live very largely on fish.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is likely enough,</q> Will agreed. <q>Let us put down
these fowls and melons under this bush, and have a nap for a
couple of hours, till we are sure that everyone is asleep. We
can then go down and have a look at the boats. Those of
them that come in late may probably leave some of their catch
on board.</q>
</p>

<p>
When they went down to the boats they found that three
of them contained a fair quantity of fish. They helped themselves
to some of these, and then retreated some distance from
the village, picking up the other provisions on the way, and
then, going into a clump of bushes, cooked a portion of the fish.
</p>

<p>
<q>That pretty well settles the question of provisions,</q> Will
said. <q>We must choose a night when there is a good wind
blowing offshore, so that we may run a good many miles before
morning. Then we must trust to falling in with one of our
cruisers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fish won’t keep long in this climate,</q> suggested Tom.
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> said Will, <q>but we can dry some of them in the sun
and they will then keep good for some time. Then we might
clean half a dozen fowls and cook them before we start.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The great difficulty will be water.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but we can get over that by stripping the gardens
clean of their melons. They weigh four or five pounds apiece
and would supply us with fluid for a week easily.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next evening they went down and made a more careful
examination of the boats. One in particular attracted their
attention. She was nearly new, and looked likely to be
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>faster than the rest. She was anchored some fifty yards
from the shore. Three more evenings were spent in prowling
about the village collecting food. It was evident that the
villagers were alarmed at their depredations, for on the third
evening they were fired at by several men. In consequence
of this they moved a mile farther away, in case a search should
be made, and the next night carried the provisions down to
the shore. As they were all expert swimmers they were soon
alongside the chosen craft. They pushed the provisions before
them on a small raft, and when they had put them on board
they made a trip to one or two of the other boats and brought
away some twenty pounds of fish. Then they cut the hawser
and hoisted sail. As they did so they heard a great tumult
on shore, and the villagers ran down to the water’s edge and
opened fire upon them. The shooting, however, was wild, and
they were very soon out of range. Several boats put off in
pursuit. This caused them some uneasiness, and they watched
them somewhat anxiously, for the wind, though favourable,
was light, and they felt by no means certain that they would
be able to keep ahead of the rowers. The stolen craft, however,
proved unexpectedly fast, and the boats, after following
fifteen miles without sensibly gaining, at last gave up the
chase. About this time, too, the wind, to their great relief,
became stronger, and the little vessel flew more and more
rapidly over the sea.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a fine craft,</q> Dimchurch said; <q>these Moors certainly
know how to build boats. It would require a smart
cutter to hold her own with us.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dimchurch kept at the helm and the other two investigated
their capture. She was three parts decked. In the cabin
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>they came upon a lantern and flint and steel, and soon had
light, which helped them greatly in their work. In the bow
ropes were stored away, while in a locker they found some
bread, which, although stale, was very acceptable. They also
unearthed two or three suits of rough sea clothes with which
they were glad to replace the light clothes they had carried
away with them from the palace grounds, for though the
weather on shore was warm the sea-breeze was chilly. Among
other useful things they also discovered several long knives,
and axes, and a flat stone for cooking upon.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now it is all a question of luck,</q> Will said; <q>the danger
will be greater when we get a bit farther out. All vessels
going up and down the Mediterranean give the Barbary coast
a wide berth. Of course those pirate fellows are most
numerous along the line of traffic, but they are to be found
right up to the Spanish, French, and Italian coasts, though of
late, I fancy, they have not been so active. There are too
many of our cruisers about for their taste, and the Spaniards,
when they get a chance, show the scoundrels no mercy.</q>
</p>

<p>
When morning broke not a sail was visible.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think, sir,</q> Dimchurch said, <q>that there is going to be
a change of weather, and that we are in for a gale.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It does not matter much. I fancy this boat would go
through it however severe it might be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, but it would check our progress, and we want to
run north as fast as we can. I see, by the line you are
making, that you are aiming at Toulon, and at our present
pace it would take us something like four days to get there.
If we are caught in a gale we may take two days longer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so,</q> Will agreed; <q>but on the other hand, if the
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>wind becomes much stronger we’ll have to take in sail, and
in that case we should have more chance of escaping notice if
we come near any of those Moorish craft. Besides, if the sea
were really rough it would be difficult for them to board us
even if they did come up with us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right, sir; still, for myself, I should prefer a
strong southerly wind and a clear sky.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am afraid you will not get your wish, for the
clouds certainly seem to be banking up from the north, and
we’ll get a change of wind ere long.</q>
</p>

<p>
By night the wind was blowing fiercely and the sea rapidly
rising. The sails were closely reefed, and even then they
felt with pleasure that the little craft was making good way.
The wind increased during the night, and was blowing a gale
by morning. Just at twelve o’clock a craft was seen approaching
which all were convinced was an Algerine. She changed
her course at once and bore down upon them, firing a gun as
a signal for them to stop.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is rather faster than we are,</q> Dimchurch said, <q>but
we’ll lead her a good dance before she gets hold of us. She
could not work her guns in this sea, and if she is the faster,
at least we are the handier.</q>
</p>

<p>
For three hours the chase continued. Again and again the
Algerine came up on them, but each time the little boat, turning
almost on her heel, so cleverly was she handled, glided
away from underneath the enemy’s bows. Each time, when
they saw the chase slipping away from them, the angry Moors
sent a volley of musketry after her, but the fugitives took
refuge in the cabin, or lay down on the deck close under the
bulwarks, and so escaped.
</p>

<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>

<p>
Soon the Moors were so intent on the chase that they
began to take great risks with their own vessel. In fact, they
became positively reckless. For this they paid very heavily.
After many disappointments they felt that the fugitives were
at last in their clutches, and were preparing to board her
when suddenly Dimchurch put down his helm sharply. He
nearly capsized the little craft, and indeed they would rather
have gone down with her than fall into the hands of the
Moors again, but she righted immediately, and once more
skimmed away from her pursuers. In the excitement of the
moment the Moorish steersman attempted the same manœuvre.
If he had succeeded he would probably have run down the
cockle-shell that had baffled him so long. But at that moment
a violent squall struck his ship with its full force, and her
mainmast snapped a few feet above the deck. The three
fugitives jumped to their feet and cheered, and then calmly
proceeded on their way.

<head>CHAPTER XII</head>

<head type="sub">BACK ON THE <q>TARTAR</q></head>

<p>
The next morning broke fair. Their late foe had dropped
out of sight on the previous evening, but now, when the
sun rose, Tom made out the top-sails of a large ship on the
horizon.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is coming towards us, lads, and by the course she is
steering she will pass within three miles of us. Is she English
or French?</q>
</p>

<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>

<p>
<q>She is too far away yet to be certain,</q> Dimchurch said,
<q>but I can’t help thinking she is French.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At any rate, Dimchurch, our best course will be to lower
the sail, shake the reef-points out, and have it ready for
hoisting at a moment’s notice. Now that the wind is light
again I should fancy we could get away from her; with a
start of two or three miles she would have no chance whatever
of catching us.</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Tom Stevens exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a sail coming up from behind. She looks to me
close-hauled. If both ships come on they are bound to meet;
if one is French and the other is English they are likely to
have a talk to each other. In that case we should be able to
tell friend from foe by the colours, and could then make
for the English ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
They sat anxiously watching the two ships, and soon they
saw that the point of meeting must be very near their own
position. Presently their hulls became visible, and Dimchurch
pronounced one to be a thirty-two-gun frigate, and the other
a forty or forty-two. They then made out that the one coming
up from the south was flying the white ensign, and at once
they hoisted their sail and made for her. Equally intent
upon a fight, the two vessels approached each other without
paying the slightest attention to the little craft.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Frenchman means fighting, and as he has ten guns
to the good he may well think he is more than a match for
our ship. Do you know her, Dimchurch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think she is the <name type="ship">Lysander</name>, sir, though I can’t be sure;
there are so many of these thirty-twos.</q>
</p>

<p>
The vessels, as they passed, exchanged broadsides. Then
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>both tacked, but the Englishman was the quicker, and he
raked the French frigate as she came round. Then they
went at it hammer and tongs. The Frenchman suffered very
heavily in spars and rigging, but at last the foremast of the
English ship fell over her side. The Frenchman at once
closed with her, and after pouring in a broadside, tried to
board her.
</p>

<p>
The little boat bore up to the stern of the English ship.
A desperate conflict was going on at that point, and failing
to get up they moved along the side. Here a rope, which
had been cut by the French fire, was hanging overboard,
and, grasping this, they climbed up to a port-hole. The deck
was deserted, all hands having rushed up to meet the attack
of the French boarders. Without a moment’s delay they
snatched cutlasses from a rack and ran up the companion
to the upper deck.
</p>

<p>
Here things were going somewhat badly. The French were
much more numerous than the English, and were forcing them
back by sheer weight of numbers. The new-comers rushed at
once into the fray, and laid about them lustily. The force
and suddenness of the onslaught caused the enemy to hesitate,
and at the same time it had the effect of inspiring to fresh
efforts the English crew, who, having lost their captain and
first lieutenant, were beginning to lose heart. They answered
the cheers of their strangely-clad allies, and with one accord
charged to meet them. At that moment Dimchurch almost
severed the French captain’s head from his body by a sweeping
blow, and the French, being disheartened by the loss
of their leader, gave way. The English sailors redoubled
their efforts, and after ten minutes of desperate fighting
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>succeeded in driving their foes back to their own ship.
Then the men ran to their guns again and the cannonade
recommenced. But the spirit of the two crews had changed.
The French were discouraged by their failure, and the British
were exultant over their success. Consequently the guns
of the English ship were fired with far more rapidity and
precision than those of the French. Several of the port-holes
of the French ship were knocked into one, and when
at last her mainmast, which had been hit several times, fell
over her side, her flag was run down amidst tremendous cheering
from the English ship.
</p>

<p>
Immediately all hands were engaged in disarming and securing
the French prisoners. When these had been sent
below, the decks of both ships were cleared of the dead.
Then the bulk of the crew set to work to cut away the
wreckage, secure damaged spars, and stop holes near the
water’s edge. At last the second lieutenant, who was now
in command, had time to turn to the strangers. Will was
superintending the work, while Dimchurch and Tom were
working hand in hand with the crew.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I ask,</q> said the lieutenant, addressing Will, <q>who it
is that has so mysteriously come to our assistance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly,</q> said Will, laughing; <q>I had quite forgotten
that I am clothed in strange garments. I am a midshipman
belonging to the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>. One of my companions is a boatswain’s
mate, and the other is an A.B. on the same ship. We
were sent with a lieutenant and ten men to overhaul a craft
which, though she was somewhat suspicious looking, seemed
to have but a small crew. When we got alongside her, however,
we found to our disgust that she was manned by at least
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>a hundred Algerines. The lieutenant and seven of the crew
were killed, and three others, my two companions, and myself
were made prisoners and carried to Algiers. We three escaped,
and, capturing the small craft which you will see lying by the
side of your ship, made for the open sea. An Algerine nearly
recaptured us in the gale yesterday, but fortunately she
carried away her mast and we again escaped. This morning
we saw two ships approaching us, and when we made out
their nationalities we knew there was bound to be a fight.
Naturally we made for your ship, and when we found that the
French had boarded you we did our best to aid you to drive
them back. My name is Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Mr. Gilmore, I have to thank you most heartily for
the very efficacious aid you have rendered us. Things were
going very badly, but your unexpected appearance, your
strange attire, and the strength and bravery with which you
fought, quite turned the tables. I think,</q> he said with a
laugh, <q>the French must have taken you for three devils
come to our assistance, and certainly you could not have
fought harder if you had been. You will, I hope, give us
your assistance until we reach Malta, to which port, of course,
I shall carry the prize. Our third lieutenant is severely
wounded, and I have lost two of my midshipmen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, sir, and I will place myself at once under your
orders.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The two midshipmen who have fallen were the seniors,</q>
the lieutenant said, <q>and as you must be two or three years
older than the others I’ll appoint you acting-lieutenant. Our
first duty here will be to rig up a jury foremast. I’ll appoint
you, however, temporary commander of the <name type="ship">Camille</name>, which is,
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>I see, the name of our prize. I can only spare you forty men.
We have lost forty-three killed and at least as many wounded,
and I have therefore only a hundred and ten altogether fit
for service, and must retain seventy for the work of refitting.
I should not attempt to get up a jury mainmast on the <name type="ship">Camille</name>.
It will be better to clear away the wreckage and secure her
other two masts in case we meet with another squall.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, sir. If either of the midshipmen that have
been killed is about my size, I should be glad to rig myself
out with a suit from his chest, for my appearance at present
is rather undignified for a British officer. I should also be
glad if the purser’s clerk would issue a couple of suits for my
two men. I may tell you that they have been with me in
every ship in which I have served, and indeed entered the
navy with me. I therefore regard them quite as personal
friends. The bigger of the two held the position of boatswain
under me in a small craft of which I had command
in the West Indies, as well as on the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, then, by all means give him the temporary
rank of boatswain on board the <name type="ship">Camille</name>, and you can appoint
the other as boatswain’s mate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir! I am very much obliged. It would be
difficult to find two better men.</q>
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes Will was attired in a midshipman’s uniform,
and his two companions, to their great relief, in the clothes
of British seamen. They then crossed to the <name type="ship">Camille</name> with the
forty men whom the lieutenant had told off as a prize crew.
Work was at once begun, and before sundown the fore and
mizzen masts were as firmly secured as if the mainmast were
still in its place. Will felt that they could now meet a storm
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>without uneasiness. Next morning the repairs to the hull
were begun, pieces of plank covered with tarred canvas being
nailed over the shot-holes, and ere the day was done the
<name type="ship">Camille</name> had a fairly presentable appearance. Meanwhile
the crew of the <name type="ship">Lysander</name> had been hard at work, and had
got the jury-foremast into position and securely stayed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have made a very good job of the prize, Mr. Gilmore,</q>
the lieutenant said. <q>Of course she is a lame duck
without her mainmast, but we’ll sail together, and so will
show a good face to any single ship we may meet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should certainly think so, sir. Should any ship heave
in sight I will get all the guns loaded on both broadsides.
Of course, I should only be able to work one side at a time,
but with forty good men I could keep up a pretty hot fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will give you ten more, Mr. Gilmore. Now that our
repairs are finished I can manage that easily, and as the
<name type="ship">Camille</name> is a bigger ship than the <name type="ship">Lysander</name> you ought certainly
to have as many as can be spared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir! I am sure I could make a good fight
with that number, and as we have covered all the shot-holes
with canvas, and so do not appear to be injured in the hull,
I don’t think any one ship would think of meddling with
us, unless, of course, she were a line-of-battle ship. In that
case our chance would be a small one, although, by presenting
a resolute front, we might cause her to sheer off without engaging
us.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately they fell in with no enemy on their way to
Malta. When they arrived in port the lieutenant went to
the flag-ship with his report. The admiral was greatly
pleased at the capture, and he was specially interested when
<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>he learned the share that Will and his two companions had
taken in the fight, and the manner in which Will had performed
his duties while in command of the <name type="ship">Camille</name>.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gilmore?</q> he asked. <q>That is the name of a young midshipman
who was on board the <name type="ship">Furious</name>. Is that the man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe he is, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, tell him to come and see me when he is disengaged.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant reported this when he returned, and a little
later Will went on board the flag-ship.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Mr. Gilmore,</q> said the admiral, <q>so you are still
to the fore. I read some time ago the official report of a midshipman
of your name in the West Indies who had captured
two vessels, each larger than the craft he commanded, and I
wondered whether it was the lad I had met here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will acknowledged that he had commanded on that
occasion.
</p>

<p>
<q>It shows that the admiral there was as struck as I was
myself with your doings, that he should have appointed you
to command that craft, when he must have had so many
senior midshipmen to select from. What had you done?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was really nothing, sir. We were lying off a pirate
stronghold, but could not get at it, as our ship was too deep
for the shallow approaches. In the course of conversation in
the midshipmen’s mess I happened to suggest that if we got
hold of some native craft we might be able to beard the lion
in his den, and one of the elder midshipmen reported the
idea to one of the lieutenants, who passed it on to the captain,
who put it into execution. The result was that we
captured two vessels and a very large amount of plunder
which they had stored on an island. I got a great deal more
<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>credit than was due to me, for I had only suggested the plan
when joking with my companions, and the captain improved
upon it greatly in carrying it out. It was very good of
him to mention in his report that the original idea was mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was a good plan,</q> the admiral said, <q>and you well
deserve the credit you got. And so it was for that that you
got the command of the cutter! Tell me about the capture of
those two pirate vessels.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will related the story of the trap that had been formed for
<name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, and the manner in which he had captured his two
  <corr sic='opponents."'>opponents.</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>Admirably managed, Mr. Gilmore,</q> the admiral said.
<q>How much longer have you to serve?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have another year yet, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, a commission is to sit here next week to pass
midshipmen. I will direct them to examine you, and will
see that you get your step the day you finish your term
of service. If I had the power I would pass you at once,
but that is one of the things an admiral cannot do. But how
was it that you got on board the <name type="ship">Lysander</name>?</q>
</p>

<p>
Will related the story of his captivity with the Algerines
and his escape.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just what I should have expected of you,</q> the admiral
said. <q>I fancy it would take a very strong prison to hold
you. Well, tell Lieutenant Hearsey that I shall expect him
to dinner to-day, and that he is to bring you with him. I’ll
ask two or three other officers to meet you, and you shall then
tell the story of your adventures.</q>
</p>

<p>
A post-captain and three other captains dined that evening
with the admiral, and when Will had modestly related his
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>adventures they complimented him highly. Two of them
happened to be on the examining committee, and consequently
Will passed almost without question. A few days later he
was appointed temporarily to a ship bound for the blockading
fleet of Toulon, where he was informed he would probably find
his own ship. When he and his two companions rejoined the
<name type="ship">Tartar</name> they were warmly congratulated on their escape from
Algiers.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sorry for the loss of Lieutenant Saxton,</q> the captain
said, when Will had reported the manner in which they had
been captured. <q rend="post: none">He was a good officer, and in this case he
was not to blame. With our telescopes we could only see a
few men on board the Algerine, and they must have kept up
the deception till the last. It is to be regretted that you
followed her so far out of reach of our guns, though, so far
as his fate was concerned, we could not have altered it even
if we had been within easy range.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At any rate, Mr. Gilmore, you were by no means to blame
in the affair, and I congratulate you on having effected your
escape with your two followers.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had only rejoined the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> a short time when, on the
5th February, 1794, the captain was signalled to proceed with
a small squadron that was to sail, under Captain Linzee of the
<name type="ship">Alcide</name>, as commodore, to Corsica, where a force under General
Paoli had asked for assistance in their endeavours to regain
their freedom.
</p>

<p>
The chief strongholds of that island were the fortified towns
of San Fiorenzo, Bastia, and Calvi. These towns are near
each other, and as the troops scornfully rejected his summons
to surrender, the commodore was placed in a difficulty. The
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>force under his command was not strong enough to blockade
the three forts at once, while they were so near each other
that to blockade one or two and leave the entrance to the
other open would have been useless. He determined at first
to take Forneilli, a fortified place two miles from San Fiorenzo,
but when he opened the attack he found that it was so much
more strongly fortified than he had anticipated that its capture
could not be effected without more loss than the gain of the
position would justify.
</p>

<p>
Lord Hood then placed a squadron of frigates under Captain
Nelson’s command to cruise off the north-western coast of the
island so as to prevent supplies being introduced, and he also
sailed there himself with some of his seventy-fours and a body
of soldiers under Major-general Dundas. Before he arrived,
Nelson had done something towards facilitating his enterprise,
for, having learned that the French in San Fiorenzo drew their
supplies of flour from a mill near the shore, he landed a body
of seamen and soldiers and burnt the mill, threw into the sea
all the flour contained in it and in a large storehouse close to
it, and regained his ship without the loss of a man.
</p>

<p>
When Lord Hood arrived he ordered Nelson to land on
the island to prevent supplies from getting into Bastia, and
took charge of the siege of San Fiorenzo himself. On his
way Nelson captured the town of Maginaggio, routed the
garrison, and destroyed a great quantity of provisions which
were being prepared for a number of French vessels in the
harbour. Lord Hood commenced the siege by attacking the
town of Mortella. The garrison fought with great bravery
and inflicted heavy loss upon the <name type="ship">Fortitude</name>, seventy-four guns,
to which the task of battering was assigned. As she was
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>evidently getting the worst of it the <name type="ship">Fortitude</name> was withdrawn,
but the shore batteries were more successful, and the place
being set on fire the garrison surrendered.
</p>

<p>
The Convention redoubt was the next place to be attacked.
It was fortified in a most formidable manner, and indeed was
so strongly constructed as to withstand any ordinary attack.
A short distance away, however, was a rock rising seven
hundred feet above the level of the sea, which entirely commanded
it. This the enemy had left unfortified and unguarded
because they believed it was inaccessible. In many
places it was almost perpendicular, and though there was a
path leading to the summit, this was in very few places wide
enough to allow more than one person to ascend at a time.
Admiral Hood in person reconnoitred and decided that a
battery could be formed on the summit.
</p>

<p>
The next day Will was on shore in command of a party
of thirty men who were to start getting up the guns. The
sailors looked at the rock and at the guns in dismay.
</p>

<p>
<q>La, Mr. Gilmore,</q> one of them said, <q>we can never get
them up there! In the first place it is too steep, and in the
second it is too rough. It would take two hundred men to
do it, and even they would not be much good, for the path
winds and twists so much that they could not put their
strength on together.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will looked at the path, and at the hill on which the new
battery was to be formed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, sir,</q> another said, <q>the path would have to be
blasted in lots of places to make room for the guns, and we
have got no tools for the job.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will did not answer. He saw that what the men said was
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>correct. Presently, however, his eye fell upon an empty rum
puncheon, and at once his thoughts flashed back to the West
Indies.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wheel that puncheon here, men.</q>
</p>

<p>
Much surprised, the men did as they were ordered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now knock out both ends, and when you have tightened
the hoops again, fill the barrel about a third full with sticks,
grass, bits of wood, anything you can come across.</q>
</p>

<p>
The men scattered at once to collect the ballast, with some
doubts in their minds as to whether the midshipman had not
gone out of his senses. In about fifteen minutes they had
carried out his instructions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dismount the gun,</q> he then ordered, <q>and put it inside
the barrel.</q>
</p>

<p>
When this had, with some difficulty, been accomplished,
and the barrel surrounded the centre of the gun, he said:
<q>Now fill up the barrel with the rest of that rubbish.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailors had now caught the idea, and very soon they
had the gun tightly packed into its novel carriage. Two long
ropes were then passed round the puncheon, the ends being
carried a little way up the hill. This formed a parbuckle,
and when the men hauled upon the upper lengths of the ropes
the cask easily rolled up to the ends of the lower lengths.
This operation was repeated again and again, and gradually
the cask moved up the rock. At places it had to be hauled
up lengthways, boards being placed underneath it to give it
a smooth surface over which to glide instead of the rough
rock, and men encouraging it from behind with levers. While
they were at work Nelson came up and stood watching them
for some minutes without speaking.
</p>

<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>

<p>
<q>Where did you learn how to do that?</q> he said to Will
at last.
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard of it at the siege of St. Pierre, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you profited by your lesson. It is a pleasure to
see a young fellow use his wits in that way. But for your
sharpness I question whether we should ever have got the
guns up there. I was looking at it myself yesterday, and I
doubted then whether it was at all practicable. You have
settled the question for me, and I’ll not forget you. What is
your name, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gilmore of the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nelson made a note of it and walked away.
</p>

<p>
The work took two days of tremendous labour, the seamen
being relieved three times a day. Will was constantly on
the spot directing and superintending the operations, and
had the satisfaction at last of seeing six guns placed on the
summit of the rock.
</p>

<p>
Next morning the besieged were astonished when the guns
opened fire upon them from the rock, for, the path being at
the back, they had not seen what was going on. As they
could obtain no shelter from this attack, and there was no
possibility of silencing the guns, they hastily abandoned the
post and retreated on San Fiorenzo. The battery on the rock,
however, also commanded the town, which, accordingly, had
to be abandoned on the following day, the garrison retiring
to the adjoining ridge of ground and to Bastia, which was
considered the strongest place in the island.
</p>

<p>
The capture of San Fiorenzo was the more valuable, inasmuch
as in the harbour were two frigates, the <name type="ship">Minerve</name> and <name type="ship">La
Fortunée</name>, both of which became our prizes. The <name type="ship">Minerve</name>,
thirty-<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>eight guns, was sunk by the French, but was weighed by our
men and taken into the service, when she was renamed the
<name type="ship">San Fiorenzo</name>.
</p>

<p>
Nelson was immensely pleased with the manner in which
the operation of getting the guns up the rock had been performed,
and requested the captain of the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> that Will
should be permanently stationed on shore to act as his own
aide-de-camp, a request which was, of course, complied with.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Nelson had reconnoitred Bastia and the
neighbouring coast, and recommended that troops and cannon
be disembarked, for he was convinced that a land force of
about a thousand, in co-operation with a few ships, would be
sufficient to reduce the place. Unfortunately the general
commanding the troops was one of the most irresolute of
men, and when, after a few days, he resigned the command,
in consequence of his differences with Lord Hood, his successor,
General D’Aubant, was still more incapable. He pronounced
at once that, though the force at his command was almost
double that which Nelson asked for, it was insufficient for the
work required of it. Nelson, burning with indignation, decided
that the attempt to take Bastia must be made, and that
if the army would not do it the navy must.
</p>

<p>
Lord Hood agreed with him, but even when it was decided
to undertake the siege, D’Aubant insisted on their doing without
a single soldier or a single cannon, and, retiring to San
Fiorenzo, kept his men inactive while the sailors were performing
the work. On the 17th of February, 1794, the fortified
town of Mareno, a little to the north of Bastia, was captured,
and four days later a reconnaissance was made. Nelson’s ship,
the <name type="ship">Agamemnon</name>, was supported by the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> and the frigate
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/><name type="ship">Romulus</name>. As they passed slowly in front of the town thirty
guns opened upon them with shot and shell. Nelson lowered
his sails, and for an hour and three-quarters peppered the forts
so warmly that at last the French garrison deserted their
guns. One battery, containing six guns, was totally destroyed.
The citizens of Bastia were eager to surrender, but the
governor declared that he would blow up the city if such a
step were taken. Two days later Nelson was preparing to
repeat the blow, but a sudden calm set in, and he could not
get near the town. In a short time the opportunity for carrying
the place by assault passed away, as the French officers
were indefatigable in strengthening their fortifications, and
soon rendered the town practically impregnable.
</p>

<p>
Nelson, however, maintained the blockade in spite of heavy
weather, and in the middle of March provisions were so short
in the place that a pound of bread was selling for half a crown.
Nelson himself was almost as much straitened for provisions,
but the admiral contrived to send him a supply.
</p>

<p>
Nelson pitched a tent on shore and personally superintended
all the operations. A considerable body of seamen
were landed, and worked like horses, dragging guns up heights
that appeared inaccessible, making roads, and cutting down
trees with which to build abattis.

<head>CHAPTER XIII</head>

<head type="sub">WITH NELSON</head>

<p>
One day during the siege Nelson said to Will: <q>I’ll be glad,
Mr. Gilmore, if you will accompany me on an excursion
along the shore. I have my eye on a spot from which, if we
could get guns up to it, we should be able to command the
town. From what I have seen of you I believe you know
more about mounting guns than anyone here, so I’ll be glad
to have your opinion of the position.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will of course expressed his willingness to go, and they at
once started in the gig. They rowed on for some time, keeping
a sharp look-out for suitable landing-places. At last
Nelson bade the men lie on their oars, and pointed to the
ridge of which he had spoken.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what do you say?</q> he asked, after Will had made
a careful examination of it from the boat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid it would not be possible, sir, to carry out your
plan. The labour of getting the guns up from the shore
would be enormous, and considering the rugged state of the
country I question if they could be taken across to the ridge
when they were up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; I agree with you. I did not examine it so closely before;
and at any rate, underhanded as we are, we could not spare
enough men for the business. We may as well, however, row
a bit along the shore. I am convinced that if we could land
three or four hundred men within five or six miles of the town,
and attack it simultaneously on both sides, we should carry it
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>without much trouble. The French have been fighting well,
but they must have been losing heart for some time. A Frenchman
hates to be cornered, and as they see our batteries rising
they cannot but feel that sooner or later they must give in.
I fancy by this time they are asking each other what use it is
to keep on being killed when they must surrender in the end.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had rowed on for a couple of hours without fixing on
a suitable place, when Nelson exclaimed: <q>We are going to be
caught in a fog. That is distinctly unpleasant. Have we a
compass in the boat?</q> he said, turning to the <anchor id="corr251"/><corr sic="coxwain">coxswain</corr>.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. I thought you were only going to row out to the
ship, and did not think of bringing one with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never forget a compass, my man,</q> Nelson said, <q>for
though the sky may be blue when you start, a sudden storm
may overtake you and blow you far from your ship. However,
it can’t be helped now.</q>
</p>

<p>
In less than ten minutes the boat was enveloped in a dense
fog. The position was decidedly awkward. Had there been
any wind they could have steered by the sound of the surf
breaking at the foot of the cliffs, but the sea was absolutely
calm, and they could hear nothing. They rowed on for some
time, and then Nelson said: <q>Lay in your oars, men, we may
be pulling in the wrong direction for all we know. We’ll
have to remain here till this fog lifts, even if it takes a week
to clear. This is a northerly fog,</q> he said to Will. <q>Cold
wind comes down from the Alps and condenses when it reaches
the sea. These fogs are not very common, but they sometimes
last for a considerable time.</q>
</p>

<p>
The afternoon passed, and presently night fell. There was
no food of any kind in the boat. The men chewed their quids,
<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>but the two officers could not indulge in that relief. At night
Nelson and Will wrapped themselves in their boat-cloaks and
made themselves as comfortable as they could, getting uneasy
snatches of sleep. Morning broke and there was no change;
a white wall of fog rose all round the boat.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is awkward,</q> Nelson said. <q>I wish one of the
batteries would fire a few guns; that might give us some
indication as to our position, though I am by no means sure
that in this thick atmosphere the sound would reach so far.
I think we were about eleven miles away when the fog caught
us.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon a breeze sprang up.
</p>

<p>
<q>God grant that it may continue!</q> Nelson said. <q>Slight
as it is, two or three hours of it might raise <anchor id="corr252"/><corr sic="as well">a swell</corr>, and we
might then hear the wash of the waves on the rocks.</q>
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour passed, but at last the coxswain said: <q>I
think I hear a faint sound over on the right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have thought so some little time,</q> Will said, <q>but I
would not speak until I was sure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Out oars,</q> Nelson ordered, <q>and row in that direction.</q>
The sound became more and more distinct as they proceeded,
and soon they were satisfied that they were heading for the
land. In a quarter of an hour the boat ran up on a sandy
beach.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have not seen this spot before, it must therefore be farther
away from the town than the point we had reached, and as
we have been nearly twenty-four hours in the fog the current
may have taken us a good many miles. However, we will
land. I am parched with thirst, and you must be the same,
lads. Leave two men in the boat; the rest of us will go in
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>search of water and bring some down to those left behind
when we find it. I think we had better scatter and look for
some way up the cliff. If we can find a path we must follow
it until we come to some house or other. Where there is a
house there must be water. Mr. Gilmore and I will go to
the right. If any of you find water, shout; we will do the
same. But whether you find water or not, come down to the
boat in three hours’ time. Thirsty or not thirsty we must row
back to the town this evening. Now, Mr. Gilmore, we will
walk along the beach until we come to a path, or at any rate
some place where we can climb. I hope, as we get higher,
the fog will become less dense.</q>
</p>

<p>
For an hour they groped their way along the foot of the
cliff, and then, finding a place where it seemed not so steep as
elsewhere, began to climb. When they had reached a height
of some three or four hundred feet they emerged from the fog
into bright sunshine. Below them stretched a white misty
lake. On all sides rose hill above hill, for the most part
covered to the top by foliage.
</p>

<p>
<q>I see some smoke rising from among the trees over there
to the right, sir, a mile or a mile and a half away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will take your word for it, Mr. Gilmore. As you know,
my sight is not at all in good condition. Let us be off at
once, for the very thought of water makes me thirstier than
ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
Half an hour’s walking brought them to the hut of a peasant.
The owner came to the door as they approached. He was a
rough-looking man in a long jacket made of goat-skin, coarse
trousers reaching down to the knee, and his legs bound with
long strips of wadding. <q>Who are you,</q> he asked in his own
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>language, <q>and how come you here?</q> As neither of the
officers understood one word of the patois of the country they
could only make signs that they wanted something to eat and
drink. The peasant understood, and beckoned to them to
come into the hut. As they entered he gave some instructions
to a boy, who went out and presently returned with a jug of
water. While the officers were quenching their thirst the boy
went out again, and the man brought from a cupboard some
black bread and goats’-milk cheese, which he set before them.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t altogether like that man’s movements, sir. He
crawls about as if he were trying to put away as much time
as possible. The boy, too, has disappeared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps he has gone to get some more water,</q> Nelson
suggested.
</p>

<p>
<q>He could have gone a dozen times by now, sir. It is
possible that he takes us for French officers. A peasant living
in such a spot as this, sixteen or twenty miles from a town,
might not even know that there are English troops in the
country.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having satisfied their hunger and thirst, they tried to make
the man understand that they were willing to buy all the
bread and cheese he had, together with a large jar for carrying
water.
</p>

<p>
The man showed a prodigious amount of stupidity, and
although his eyes glistened when Nelson produced gold, he
still seemed unable to understand that, having had as much
as they could eat, they wanted to buy more. At last Nelson,
in a passion, said: <q>Look here, my man, there is a sovereign,
which is worth at least twenty times your miserable store of
bread and cheese. If you don’t choose to accept the money
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>you needn’t, but we will take the food whether or no,</q> and
he pointed to his store. As he spoke there was a sound of
footsteps outside, and a moment later the door was darkened
by the entry of a dozen wild figures, who flung themselves
upon the two officers before they had time to make any effort
to defend themselves.
</p>

<p>
In vain Nelson attempted in French and Italian to make
himself understood. The men would not listen, but poured
out objurgations upon them whenever they attempted to speak.
The word Français frequently occurred in their speeches,
mixed up with what were evidently expressions of hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is awkward, Mr. Gilmore,</q> Nelson said quietly as
they lay bound together in a corner of the hut. <q>A more
unpleasant situation I was never in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was in one as bad once before. I was captured by a band
of negroes in Cuba, and they were preparing to burn me alive
when I managed to escape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should not be at all surprised if that is what these gentlemen
are preparing to do now, Gilmore. I am sorry I have
brought you into this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cannot be helped, sir,</q> Will said cheerfully; <q>and if
they do kill us, my loss to the nation will be as nothing compared
with yours. There is no doubt they take us for French
officers who have lost their way in the mountains, and they
are preparing to punish us for the misdeeds of our supposed
countrymen. There are only two things that could help us
out of this plight so far as I can see. One is the arrival of a
priest; I suppose they have priests hereabouts with a knowledge
of French or Italian. The other is the appearance on the
scene of our boat’s crew.</q>
</p>

<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>

<p>
<q>Both are very unlikely, I am afraid. The crew, you know,
all went the other way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir; but it is just possible that they may have seen
the smoke of this hut also, and be making their way here.
Though I looked carefully on all sides I could see no other
signs of life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is possible,</q> Nelson said; <q>but for my part I think the
priest the more likely solution, if there is to be a solution.
Well, it is a comfort to know that we have eaten a hearty
meal and shall not die hungry or thirsty. It was foolish of
us to come up here alone, knowing what wild savages these
people in the mountains are. It would have been better to
have gone on suffering ten or twelve hours longer, and to have
made our way to the fleet by following close in by the foot of
the rocks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t think we could have done it in that time, sir. We
should have had to keep within an oar’s-length of the rocks,
and so must have progressed very slowly. Besides, we might
have staved in the boat at any moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so. Still, we were only drifting for about twenty-four
hours, and we shouldn’t have taken so long to go back.
Even twenty-four hours of hunger and thirst would have been
better than this. It is useless, however, to think of that now.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the men were engaged in a noisy talk, each
one apparently urging his own view. At last they seemed to
come to an agreement, and four of them, going to the corner,
dragged the two officers to their feet, and hauled them out of
the cottage. Then they bound them to trees seven or eight
feet apart, and piled faggots round them. When this was
done they amused themselves by dancing wildly round their
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>prisoners, taunting them and heaping execrations upon
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>The sooner this comes to an end the better,</q> Nelson said
quietly. <q>Well, Mr. Gilmore, we have both the satisfaction
of knowing that we have done our duty to our country. After
all, it makes no great difference to a man whether he dies in
battle or is burnt, except that the burning method lasts a little
longer. But it won’t last long in our case, I fancy. Do you
notice that these faggots are all lately cut? We’ll probably be
suffocated before the flames touch us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see that, sir, and am very grateful for it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The dance was finished, and two men brought brands from
the cottage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Mr. Gilmore,</q> said Nelson at this moment. <q>I
think I can hear footsteps; I am sure I heard a branch crack.</q>
</p>

<p>
Brands were applied to the faggots, but these were so
green that at first they would not catch. At this, several of
the peasants rushed into the cottage, and were returning
with larger brands, when some figures suddenly appeared at
the edge of the little clearing in the direction from which
Nelson had heard sounds. They stood silent for a minute,
looking at the scene, and then with a loud shout they rushed
forward with drawn cutlasses and attacked the natives. Four
or five of the peasants were cut down, and the remainder fled
in terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God, your honour, we have arrived in time!</q> the
coxswain said as he cut Nelson’s bonds, while another sailor
liberated Will.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God indeed! Now, my lads, we have not a moment
to lose. Those fellows are sure to gather a number of their
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>comrades at the nearest village, and I have no wish to see any
more of them. Go into that hut; you will find enough bread
and cheese there to give you each a meal, and there is a spring
of water close by.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sailors scattered at once, and were not long in discovering
the spring. There they knelt down and drank long and
deeply. Then they went into the cottage and devoured the
bread and cheese, which, although far from being sufficient to
satisfy them, at least appeased their hunger for a time. After
they had finished they all went back to the spring for another
drink. Then, taking some bread and cheese and a large jug
of water for the boat keepers, they followed Nelson and Will
from the place which had so nearly proved fatal to their officers.
They went down the hill at a brisk pace until they reached
the top of the fog. After this they proceeded more cautiously.
They had no longer any fear of pursuit, for, once in the fog,
it would require an army to find them. At last they reached
the strand and found the boat. When the two men who had
been left in charge had finished their share of the food and
water, Nelson said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, my lads, we must row on. If we keep close to the
foot of the rocks, that is, within fifty yards of them, the noise
of the waves breaking will be a sufficient guide to prevent our
getting too far out to sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>May I be so bold as to ask how far we’ll have to row?</q> the
coxswain said.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is more than I can tell you. It may be a little over
eleven miles, it may be twice or even three times that distance.
Now, however, that you have had something to eat and drink
you can certainly row on until we reach the ships.</q>
</p>

<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>

<p>
<q>That we can, sir. We feel like new men again, though
we did feel mighty bad before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So did we, lads. Now it is of no use your trying to row
racing pace; take a long, quiet stroke, and every hour or two
rest for a few minutes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be dark before very long,</q> Nelson remarked quietly
to Will when the men began to row; <q>but fortunately that
will make no difference to us, as we are guided not by our
eyes but by our ears. There is more wind than there was,
and on a still night like this we can hear the waves against
the rocks half a mile out, so there is no fear of our losing our
way, and it will be hard indeed if we don’t reach the ships
before daylight. The boat is travelling about four knots an
hour. If the current has not carried us a good deal farther
than we imagine, five or six hours ought to take us there.</q>
</p>

<p>
The hours passed slowly. Sometimes the men had to row
some distance seaward to avoid projecting headlands. At last,
however, about twelve o’clock, Will exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
<q>I hear a ripple, sir, like the water against the bow of a
ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Easy all!</q> Nelson said at once.
</p>

<p>
The order was obeyed, and all listened intently. Presently
there was a general exclamation as the sound of footsteps was
heard ahead.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a marine pacing up and down on sentry. Give
way, lads.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes a black mass rose up close in front of
them. The coxswain put the helm down, and the boat glided
along the side of the ship. As she did so there came the
sharp challenge of a sentry:
</p>

<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>

<p>
<q>Who goes there? Answer, or I fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is all right, my man; it is Captain Nelson.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait till I call the watch, Captain Nelson,</q> the sentry
replied in the monotonous voice of his kind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, sentry, you are quite right to do your duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
In half a minute an officer’s voice was heard above, and a
lantern was shown over the side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it you, sir?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; what ship is this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The <name type="ship">Romulus</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you lend me a compass?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, I will fetch one in a moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you!</q> Nelson said when the officer returned with
the instrument. <q>I have lost my bearings in the fog, and I
want to get to my tent on shore. I know its exact bearings,
however, from this ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes’ row brought them to the landing-place.
Nelson’s first thought was for the crew, and, going to the
storehouse close at hand, he knocked some of the people up,
and saw that they were supplied with plenty of food and
drink. Then he went into his tent. Here the table was
spread, with various kinds of food standing on it. His servant
being called up, a kettle was boiled, and he and Will sat down
to a hearty meal.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know what has been said about us in our absence,
Chamfrey?</q> Nelson asked his servant.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir; everything has been upset by this fog. They sent
down from the batteries to enquire where you and Mr. Gilmore
were, and we could only say that we supposed you were on
board the ship. They sent from the ships to ask, and we
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>could only say that we didn’t know, but supposed that you
were somewhere up in the batteries. Some thought, when
you did not return this afternoon, that you had lost your
way in the fog; but no one seemed to think that anything
serious could have happened to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nelson got up and went to where the boat’s crew were
sitting after having finished their meal.
</p>

<p>
<q>Coxswain, here are two guineas for yourself and a guinea
for each of the men. Now I want every man of you to keep
his mouth tightly shut about what has happened. I promise
you that if any man blabs he will be turned out of my gig.
You understand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir,</q> they replied together. <q>You can trust us to
keep our mouths shut. We will never say a word about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a good thing,</q> Nelson remarked when he returned
to Will. <q>If what has happened came to be known, I should
get abused by Lord Hood for having gone so far away and
run so great a risk. Of course, as you and I are aware, there
would have been no risk at all if that fog had not set in and
we had not forgotten to bring a compass. But, you know,
a naval man is supposed to foresee everything, and I should
have been blamed just as much as if I had rowed into the fog
on purpose. I should have had all the captains in the fleet
remonstrating with me, and they would be saying: <q>I knew,
Nelson, the way you are always running about, that you would
get into some scrape or other one of these days.</q> A report,
indeed, might be sent to England, enormously magnified, of
course, with the headings: <q>Captain Nelson lost in a fog!</q>
<q>Captain Nelson roasted alive by Corsican brigands!</q> I
would not have the news get about for five hundred guineas.
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>I don’t suppose my absence was noticed the first day. It was
known, of course, that I went off in my gig; but as I sometimes
sleep here and sometimes on board my ship, the fact
that I was not in either place would not cause surprise. As
for to-day, if any questions are asked, I’ll simply say that
I lost my way in the fog and did not return here until late
at night, a tale which will have the advantage of being true.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may be sure, sir, that no word shall pass my lips on
the matter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am quite sure of that, Mr. Gilmore. I shall never
forget this danger we have shared together, nor how well you
bore the terrible trial. I shall always regard you as one of
my closest comrades and friends, and when the time comes will
do my best to further your interests. I have not much power
at present, as one of Lord Hood’s captains, but the time may
come when I shall be able to do something for you, and I can
assure you that when that opportunity arrives I shall need no
reminder of my promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
By the 11th of April, 1794, the three batteries were completed,
and they at once opened fire on the town. The garrison
vigorously replied with hot shot, which set fire to a ship that
had been converted into a battery. Still D’Aubant remained
inactive. The sailors, fired with indignation, worked even
harder than before. Nelson now felt confident of success.
He predicted that the place would fall between the 11th and
17th of May, and his prediction was fulfilled almost to the
letter, for at four o’clock on the afternoon of the 11th a boat
came out from the town to the <name type="ship">Victory</name> offering to surrender.
That afternoon, General D’Aubant, having received some reinforcements
from Gibraltar, arrived from San Fiorenzo only to
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>find that the work he had pronounced impracticable had been
done without his assistance.
</p>

<p>
Will had spent the whole of his time during the siege on
shore. He had laboured incessantly in getting the guns up
to their positions, and had been placed in command of one of
the batteries. Nelson specially recommended him for his services,
and Lord Hood mentioned him in his despatches to the
Admiralty at home.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had Bastia fallen than the admiral determined
to besiege Calvi, the one French stronghold left in the island.
The news came, however, that a part of the French fleet had
broken out of Toulon, and Lord Hood at once started in pursuit,
leaving Nelson to conduct the operations.
</p>

<p>
Taking the troops, which were now commanded by General
Stuart, a man of very different stamp from D’Aubant, Nelson
landed them on the 19th June without opposition at a narrow
inlet three miles and a half from the town. A body of seamen
were also landed under Will. These instantly began, as at
Bastia, to get the guns up the hills to form a battery.
</p>

<p>
The enemy were strongly protected with four outlying forts.
There were also in the harbour two French frigates, the <name type="ship">Melpomene</name>
and the <name type="ship">Mignonne</name>. The proceedings resembled those at
Bastia. The work accomplished was tremendous, and batteries
sprang up as if by magic.
</p>

<p>
At the end of June Lord Hood returned from watching the
French, and the work proceeded even more vigorously than
before. As at Bastia, Nelson animated his men by his
energy and example. He himself was wounded by some
stones which were driven up by a shot striking the ground
close to him, and lost the sight of his right eye for ever.
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>But although his suffering was very severe he would not
interrupt his labours for a single day. Presently the batteries
opened fire, and one by one the outlying forts were stormed,
and the town itself attacked. At last, on the 1st of August,
the enemy proposed a capitulation. This was granted to them
on the terms that if the Toulon fleet did not arrive in seven
days they would lay down their arms, and surrender the two
frigates. The Toulon fleet was, however, in no position to risk
a battle with Lord Hood’s powerful squadron, and accordingly
on the 10th the garrison surrendered and marched out of the
great gate of the town with the honours of war. Nelson
was exultant at the thought that the capture of this town, as
well as Bastia, was the achievement of his sailors, that the
batteries had been constructed by them, the guns dragged up
by them, and with the exception only of a single artillery-man
all the guns also fought by them.
</p>

<p>
Will gained very great credit by his work. He had a
natural gift for handling heavy weights, and he had thoroughly
learnt the lesson that the power and endurance of English
sailors could surmount obstacles that appeared insuperable.

<head>CHAPTER XIV</head>

<head type="sub">THE GLORIOUS FIRST OF JUNE</head>

<p>
It was while besieging Calvi that the news came of the great
sea-battle fought in the Channel by Lord Howe, and very
much interested were the sailors on shore in Corsica at hearing
the details of the victory. A vast fleet had assembled at
Spit<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>head under the command of the veteran Lord Howe. It had
two objects in view besides the primary one of engaging the
enemy. First, the convoying of the East and West India and
Newfoundland merchant fleets clear of the Channel; and next,
of intercepting a French convoy returning from America laden
with the produce of the West India Islands. It consisted of
thirty-four line-of-battle ships and fifteen frigates, while the
convoy numbered ninety-nine merchantmen.
</p>

<p>
On 2nd May, 1794, the fleet sailed from Spithead, and
on the 5th they arrived off the Lizard. Here Lord Howe
ordered the convoys to part company with the fleet, and
detached Rear-admiral Montagu with six seventy-fours and
two frigates with orders to see the merchantmen to the latitude
of Cape Finisterre, where their protection was to be
confided to Captain Rainier with two battle-ships and four
frigates.
</p>

<p>
Lord Howe now proceeded to Ushant, where he discovered,
by means of his frigates, that the enemy’s fleet were quietly
anchored in the harbour of Brest.
</p>

<p>
He therefore proceeded in search of the American convoy.
After cruising in various directions for nearly a fortnight he
returned to Ushant on the 18th May, only to find that Brest
harbour was empty. News was obtained from an American
vessel that the French fleet had sailed from that harbour a
few days before. It afterwards turned out that the two fleets
had passed quite close to each other unseen, owing to a dense
fog that prevailed at the time. They were exactly the same
strength in numbers, but the French carried much heavier
guns, and their crews exceeded ours by three thousand men.
</p>

<p>
For more than a week the two fleets cruised about in the
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>Bay of Biscay, each taking many prizes, but without meeting.
At last, early on the morning of the 28th of May, they came
in sight of each other. The French were to windward, and,
having a strong south west wind with them, they came down
rapidly towards us, as if anxious to fight. Presently they
shortened sail and formed line of battle. Howe signalled to
prepare for battle, and having come on to the same tack as
the French, stood towards them, having them on his weather
quarter. Soon, however, the French tacked and seemed to
retreat. A general chase was ordered, and the English ships
went off in pursuit under full sail. Between two and three
o’clock the <name type="ship">Russell</name>, which was the fastest of the seventy-fours,
began to exchange shots with the French, and towards evening
another seventy-four, the <name type="ship">Bellerophon</name>, began a close action
with the <name type="ship">Révolutionnaire</name>, one hundred and ten guns. The
<name type="ship">Bellerophon</name> soon lost her main top-mast, and dropped back;
but the fight with the great ship was taken up, first by the
<name type="ship">Leviathan</name> and afterwards by the <name type="ship">Audacious</name>, both seventy-fours,
which, supported by two others, fought her for three hours.
By that time the <name type="ship">Révolutionnaire</name> had a mast carried away and
great damage done to her yards, and had lost four hundred
men. When darkness fell she was a complete wreck, and it was
confidently expected that in the morning she would fall into
our hands. At break of day, however, the French admiral
sent down a ship which took her in tow, for her other mast
had fallen during the night, and succeeded in taking her in
safety to Rochefort. The <name type="ship">Audacious</name> had suffered so severely
in the unequal fight that she was obliged to return to Plymouth
to repair damages.
</p>

<p>
During the night the hostile fleets steered under press of
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>canvas on a parallel course, and when daylight broke were still
as near together as on the previous day, but the firing was of
a desultory character, Lord Howe’s efforts to bring on a general
engagement being thwarted by some of the ships misunderstanding
his signals. The next day was one of intense fog,
but on the 31st the weather cleared, and the fleets towards
evening were less than five miles apart. A general action
might have been brought on, but Lord Howe preferred to
wait till daylight, when signals could more easily be made out.
Our admiral was surprised that none of the French ships
showed any damage from the action of the 29th. It was
afterwards found that they had since been joined by four
fresh ships, and that the vessels that had suffered most had
been sent into Brest.
</p>

<p>
During the 31st various manœuvres had been performed,
which ended by giving us the weather-gage; and the next
morning, the 1st of June, Lord Howe signalled that he intended
to attack the enemy, and that each ship was to steer
for the one opposed to her in the line. The ships were
arranged so that each vessel should be opposite one of equal
size. The <name type="ship">Defence</name> led the attack, and came under a heavy
fire. The admiral’s ship, the <name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name>, pressed forward,
replying with her quarter-deck guns only to the fire of some
of the French ships which assailed her as she advanced, keeping
the fire of her main-deck guns for the French admiral,
whom he intended to attack. So close and compact, however,
were the French lines that it was no easy matter to pass
through. As the <name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name> came under the stern of the
<name type="ship">Montagne</name> she poured in a tremendous fire from her starboard
guns at such close quarters that the rigging of the two vessels
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>were touching. The <name type="ship">Jacobin</name>, the next ship to the <name type="ship">Montagne</name>,
shifted her position and took up that which the <name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name>
had intended to occupy. Lord Howe then engaged the two
vessels, and his fire was so quick that ere long both had to
fall out of the fight. A furious combat followed between the
<name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name> and the <name type="ship">Juste</name>, in which the latter was totally
dismasted. The former lost her main-topmast, and as she had
previously lost her fore-topmast she became totally unmanageable.
</p>

<p>
Thus almost single-handed, save for the distant fire of the
<name type="ship">Invincible</name>, Lord Howe fought these three powerful ships. At
this time a fourth adversary appeared in the <name type="ship">Républicain</name>, one
hundred and ten guns, carrying the flag of Rear-admiral
Bouvet. Just as they were going to engage, however, the
<name type="ship">Gibraltar</name> poured in a broadside, bringing down the main and
mizzen-masts of the Frenchman, who bore up and passed
under the stern of the <name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name>, but so great was the
confusion on board her that she neglected to rake the flagship.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Montagne</name>, followed by the <name type="ship">Jacobin</name>, now crowded on all
sail; and Lord Howe, thinking they intended to escape, gave
the order for a general chase, but they were joined by nine
other ships, and wore round and sailed towards the <name type="ship">Queen</name>.
This craft was almost defenceless, owing to the loss of her
mainmast and mizzen-topmast.
</p>

<p>
Seeing her danger, Lord Howe signalled to his ships to
close round her, and he himself wore round and stood to her
assistance.
</p>

<p>
He was followed by five other battle-ships, and Admiral
Villaret-Joyeuse gave up the attempt and sailed to help his
own crippled ships, and, taking five of them in tow, made off.
</p>

<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>

<p>
Six French battle-ships were captured, and the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name>,
which had been engaged in a desperate fight with the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name>,
went down ten minutes after she surrendered.
</p>

<p>
The British loss in the battle of the 1st of June, and in
the preliminary skirmishes of the 28th and 29th of May, was
eleven hundred and forty-eight, of whom two hundred and
ninety were killed and eight hundred and fifty-eight wounded.
</p>

<p>
The French placed their loss in killed and mortally wounded
at three thousand, so that their total loss could not have been
much under seven thousand.
</p>

<p>
Decisive as the victory was, it was the general opinion in
the fleet that more ought to have been done; that the five
disabled ships should have been taken, and a hot chase instituted
after the flying enemy. Indeed, the only explanation of
this inactivity was that the admiral, who was now an old man,
was so enfeebled and exhausted by the strain through which
he had gone as to be incapable of coming to any decision or
of giving any order.
</p>

<p>
One of the most desperate combats in this battle was that
which took place between the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name>, seventy-four guns,
under Captain John Harvey, and the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name>, also a seventy-four.
The <name type="ship">Brunswick</name> had not been engaged in the battles of
the 28th and 29th of May, but she played a brilliant part on
the 1st of June. She was exposed to a heavy fire as the fleet
bore down to attack, and she suffered some losses before she
had fired a shot. She steered for the interval between the
<name type="ship">Achille</name> and <name type="ship">Vengeur</name>. The former vessel at once took up a
position closing the gap, and Captain Harvey then ran foul
of the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name>, her anchors hooking in the port fore channels
of the Frenchman.
</p>

<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>

<p>
The two ships now swung close alongside of each other, and,
paying off before the wind, they ran out of the line, pouring
their broadsides into each other furiously.
</p>

<p>
The upper-deck guns of the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name> got the better of those
of the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name>, killing several officers and men, and wounding
Captain Harvey so severely as to compel him to go
below.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the <name type="ship">Achille</name> bore down on the <name type="ship">Brunswick’s</name>
quarter, but was received by a tremendous broadside, which
brought down her remaining mast, a foremast. The wreck
prevented the <name type="ship">Achille</name> from firing, and she surrendered; but
as the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name> was too busy to attend to her, she hoisted a
sprit-sail—a sail put up under the bowsprit—and endeavoured
to make off.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name> and <name type="ship">Vengeur</name>, fast locked, continued
their desperate duel. The upper-deck guns of the former
were almost silenced, but on the lower decks the advantage
was the other way. Alternately depressing and elevating
their guns to their utmost extent, the British sailors either
fired through their enemy’s bottom or ripped up her decks.
</p>

<p>
Captain Harvey, who had returned to the deck, was again
knocked down by a splinter, but continued to direct operations
till he was struck in the right arm and so severely
injured as to force him to give up the command, which now
devolved on Lieutenant Cracroft, who, however, continued to
fight the ship as his captain had done.
</p>

<p>
After being for some three hours entangled, the two ships
separated, the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name> tearing away the <name type="ship">Brunswick’s</name> anchor. As
they drifted apart, some well-aimed shots from the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name>
smashed her enemy’s rudder-post and knocked a large hole
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>in the counter. At this moment the <name type="ship">Ramillies</name>, sailing up,
opened fire at forty yards’ distance at this particular hole. In
a few minutes she reduced the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name> to a sinking condition,
and then proceeded to chase the <name type="ship">Achille</name>. The <name type="ship">Vengeur</name> now
surrendered. The <name type="ship">Brunswick</name>, however, could render no assistance,
all her boats being damaged, but, hoisting what sail she
could, headed northward with the intention of making for port.
During the fight the <name type="ship">Brunswick</name> lost her mizzen, and had her
other masts badly damaged, her rigging and sails cut to pieces,
and twenty-three guns dismounted. She lost three officers
and forty-one men killed; her captain, second lieutenant, one
midshipman, and one hundred and ten men wounded. Captain
Harvey only survived his wounds a few months.
</p>

<p>
The greater portion of the crew of the <name type="ship">Vengeur</name> were taken
off by the boats of the <name type="ship">Alfred</name>, <name type="ship">Culloden</name>, and <name type="ship">Rattler</name>, but she
sank before all could be rescued, and two hundred of her
crew, most of whom were wounded, were drowned. Among
the survivors were Captain Renaudin and his son. Each was
ignorant of the rescue of the other, and when they met by
chance at Portsmouth their joy can be better imagined than
described.

<p>
The <name type="ship">Tartar</name> returned to the blockade of Toulon after the
work in Corsica was done. When she had been there some
time she was ordered to cruise on the coast, where there were
several forts under which French coasting-vessels ran for shelter
when they saw an English sail approaching, and she was, if
possible, to destroy them. There was one especially, on one of
the Isles d’Hyères, which the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> was particularly ordered
to silence, as more than any other it was the resort of coasters.
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>The <name type="ship">Tartar</name> sailed in near enough to it to exchange shots,
and so got some idea of the work they had to undertake;
then, having learned all she could, she stood out to sea again.
All preparations were made during the day for a landing;
arms were distributed, and the men told off to the boats.
After nightfall she again sailed in, and arrived off the forts
about midnight. The boats had already been lowered, and
the men took their places in them while the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> was still
moving through the water, and, dividing into three parties,
made respectively for the three principal batteries.
</p>

<p>
Dimchurch was not in the boat in which Will had a place,
as he rowed stroke of the first gig and Will was in the launch.
Tom was also in another boat, but was in the same division.
No lights were to be seen, and absolute silence reigned.
Noiselessly the men landed and formed up on the beach.
To reach the batteries they had to climb the cliff by a zigzag
pathway, up which they were obliged to go in single file.
They arrived at the summit without apparently creating
a suspicion of their presence, and then advanced at a run.
Suddenly three blue lights gleamed out, illuminating the whole
of the ground they had to traverse, and at the same moment
a tremendous volley was fired from the battery. Simultaneously
fire opened from the other batteries, showing that the
boats’ crews had all arrived just at the same instant, and
that while the French were supposed to be asleep they were
awake and vigilant. Indeed, from the heaviness of the fire
there was little question that the force on the island had
been heavily reinforced from the mainland.
</p>

<p>
Numbers of the men fell, but nevertheless the sailors rushed
forward fearlessly and reached the foot of the fort. This was
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>too high to be climbed, so, separating, they ran round to endeavour
to effect an entrance elsewhere. Suddenly they were
met by a considerable body of troops. The first lieutenant,
who commanded the division, whistled the order for the sailors
to fall back. This was done at first slowly and in some sort
of order, but the fire kept up on them was so hot that they
were compelled to increase their pace to a run. A stand was
made at the top of the pass, as here the men were only able
to retreat in single file. At length the survivors all reached
the beach and took to the boats again under a heavy fire
from the top of the cliffs, which, however, was to some extent
kept down by the guns of the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>. The other divisions
had suffered almost as severely, and the affair altogether cost
the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> fifty killed and over seventy wounded. Will was
in the front rank when the French so suddenly attacked
them, and was in the rear when the retreat began. Suddenly
a shot struck him in the leg and he fell. In the confusion
this was not noticed, and he lay there for upwards of an hour,
when, the fire of the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> having ceased, the French came
out with lanterns to search for the wounded. Will was lifted
and carried to some barracks behind the fort, where his wound
was attended to. They asked whether he spoke French, and
as, though he had studied the language whenever he had had
time and opportunity and had acquired considerable knowledge
of it, he was far from being able to speak it fluently, he
replied that he did not, a French officer came to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is your name, monsieur?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>William Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is your rank?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Midshipman.</q>
</p>

<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>

<p>
<q>Age?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nearly nineteen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nationality, English</q> was added.
</p>

<p>
<q>What ship was that from which you landed?</q>
</p>

<p>
There was no reason why the question should not be
answered, and he replied: <q>The <name type="ship">Tartar</name>, thirty-four guns.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you have made a bad evening’s business, monsieur!</q>
the officer said. <q>When the ship was seen to sail in and sail
away again, after firing a few shots, we felt sure that she
would come back to-night, and five hundred men were brought
across from the mainland to give you a hot reception. And,
parbleu, we did so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did indeed,</q> Will said, <q>a desperately hot reception.
I cannot tell what our loss was, but it must have been very
heavy. You took us completely by surprise, which was what
we had intended to do to you. Well, it is the fortune of war,
and I must not grumble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will be sent to Toulon as soon as you can be moved,
monsieur.</q>
</p>

<p>
Three other wounded officers had fallen into the hands of
the enemy, and these were placed in the same room as Will.
One was the third lieutenant, another the master’s mate, and
the third was a midshipman. They were well treated and cared
for and were very cheery together, with the exception of the
lieutenant, whose wound was a mortal one, and who died two
days after the fight.
</p>

<p>
A month after their reception into the hospital all were able
to walk, and they were taken across in a boat to the mainland
and sent to Toulon. They were all asked if they would give
their parole, and though his two companions agreed to do so,
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>Will refused. He was accordingly sent to a place of confinement,
while the other two were allowed to take quarters in
the town.
</p>

<p>
Will was privately glad of this, for, though both were
pleasant fellows, he thought that if he were to make his
escape it must be alone, and had the others been quartered
with him he could not well have left them. His prison was a
fort on a hill which ran out into the sea, and Will could see
the sails of the blockading vessels as they cruised backwards
and forwards. He also commanded a view over the town,
with its harbour crowded with shipping, its churches, and
fortifications. He longed continually for the company of his
two faithful followers, Dimchurch and Tom. They had been
with him in all his adventures, and he felt that if they were
together again they would be able to contrive some plan of
escape. At present no scheme occurred to him. The window
of the room in which he was confined was twenty feet
from the ground, and was protected by iron bars. In front
was a wall some twelve feet high, enclosing a courtyard in
which the garrison paraded and drilled. At night sentinels
were planted at short intervals, from which Will concluded
that there must be many other prisoners besides himself in
the fort. He was attended by an old soldier, with whom he
often had long chats.
</p>

<p>
<q>They certainly know how to make prisons,</q> he grumbled
to himself. <q>If it was not that I shall never lose hope of
something turning up, I would accept my parole.</q>
</p>

<p>
After he had been there for three months he was one day
led out and, with three other midshipmen, taken down to a
prison in the town. He had no doubt that prisoners of more
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>importance had arrived, and that he and the others had been
moved to make way for them. A month later they were
again taken out, and, having been joined by a hundred other
prisoners under a strong guard, were marched out of the town.
There were five officers among them, and the rest were seamen.
All were glad of the change, though it was not likely
to be for the better. Will was sorry, inasmuch as at Toulon
he could always hope that if he escaped from prison he would
be able to get hold of a boat and row out to the blockading
squadron. Inland he felt that escape would be vastly more
difficult. Even if he got out of prison he knew but little
French, and therefore could hardly hope to make his way across
country. They trudged along day after day, each according
to his fancy, some sullen and morose, others making the best
of matters and trying to establish some speaking acquaintance
with their guards, who evidently regarded the march as a sort
of holiday after the dull routine of life in a garrison town.
Will, who had during his imprisonment at Toulon studied to
improve his French to the best of his ability by the aid of
some books he had obtained and by chatting with his jailer,
worked his hardest to add to his knowledge of the language,
and as the French soldiers were quite glad to beguile the time
away by talking with their captives, he succeeded at the end
of the journey, which lasted nearly a month, in being able to
chat with a certain amount of fluency. Verdun was one of
the four places in which British prisoners were confined. At
that time France had fifteen thousand prisoners, England
forty thousand. By an agreement between the governments
these were held captive in certain prisons, so that they could,
when occasion offered, be exchanged; but owing to the vastly
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>greater number of English prisoners the operation went on
very slowly. The health of the prison was bad, the large
number confined in the narrow space, and the lack of sanitary
arrangements, causing a vast amount of fever to prevail.
</p>

<p>
When he got to Verdun, Will continued to devote himself
to the study of French. He knew that, should he escape, he
could have no hope of finding his way across country unless he
could speak the language fluently, and accordingly he passed
the whole day in conversation with the guards and others
employed about the prison. These were inclined to regard
his anxiety to become proficient in the language as a national
compliment. Some of the prisoners also knew French well, so
that at the end of four months he could talk with perfect
fluency. He was a good deal laughed at by the English officers
for the zeal he was displaying in studying French, for, as
they said, he might as well try to get to the moon as out
of Verdun. He accepted their chaff good-humouredly, and
simply said: <q>Time will show, but for my part I would as
soon be shot as continue to live as prisoner here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Many of the prisoners passed their time in manufacturing
little trifles. The sailors, for the most part, made models of
ships; some of them were adepts at sewing patchwork quilts,
and got their warders to purchase scraps of various materials
for the purpose. The soldiers were also, many of them, skilled
in making knick-knacks. These were sold in the town, chiefly
to country people who came in to market, and so their makers
were able to purchase tobacco and other little luxuries. A few
of the prisoners were allowed every day to go into the town,
which, being strongly walled, offered no greater facility for
escape than did the prison itself. They carried with them
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>and sold their own manufactures and those of other prisoners,
and with the proceeds purchased the things they required.
</p>

<p>
Several times Will was one of those allowed out, and he
set himself to work to make the acquaintance of some of
the townspeople. As he was one of the few who could
speak French, he had no difficulty in getting up a chatty
acquaintance with several people, among them a young girl
living in a house close to the wall. She had looked pitifully
at him the first time he had come out with a small load of
merchandise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, my poor young fellow,</q> she said in French, <q>how
hard it is for you to be thus kept a prisoner far from all your
friends!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, mademoiselle,</q> he said, <q>but it is the fortune
of war, and English as well as French must submit to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak French!</q> she said. <q>Yes, yes, monsieur, I
feel it as much as any. There is one who is very dear to me
a prisoner in England. He is a soldier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, mademoiselle, it is a pity that they don’t exchange
us. We give a lot of trouble to your people, and the French
prisoners give a lot of trouble to ours, so it would be much
better to restore us to our friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! that is what I say. How happy I should be if my
dear Lucien were restored to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
So the acquaintance became closer and closer, and at last
Will ventured to say: <q>If I were back in England, mademoiselle,
I might perhaps get your Lucien out. You could
give me his name and the prison in which he is confined,
and it would be hard if I could not manage to aid him to
escape.</q>
</p>

<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>

<p>
<q>Ah, monsieur, that would be splendid!</q> the girl said,
clasping her hands. <q>If you could but get away!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, mademoiselle, I think I could manage to escape if I
had but a little help. For example, from the top window of
this house I think I could manage to jump upon the wall, and
if you could but furnish me with a rope I could easily make
my escape. Of course I should want a suit of peasant’s clothes,
for, you see, I should be detected at once if I tried to get
away in this uniform. I speak French fairly now, and think
I could pass as a native.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak it very well, monsieur, but oh, I dare not help
you to escape!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not asking you to, mademoiselle; I am only saying
how it could be managed, and that if I could get back to
England I might aid your lover.</q>
</p>

<p>
The girl was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>It could never be,</q> she murmured.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not asking it, mademoiselle; and now I must be
going on.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next time he came she said: <q>I have been thinking
over what you said, monsieur, and I feel that it would be
cowardly indeed if I were to shrink from incurring some little
danger for the sake of Lucien. I know that he would give
his life for me. We were to have been married in a fortnight,
when they came and carried him off to the war. Now tell me
exactly what you want me to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I want a disguise, the dress of a travelling pedlar. I
could give you two English sovereigns, which would be ample
to get that. I want also a rope forty feet long. Then you
must let me go up through your house to the top story. I
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>have been looking at it from behind, and see that from the
upper window I could climb up to the roof, and I am sure
that from there I could easily jump across the narrow lane to
the wall.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will do it, monsieur, partly for Lucien and partly because
you are kind and gentle and,</q> she added with a little
blush and laugh, <q>good-looking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you with all my heart, mademoiselle, and I swear
to you that when I get to England I will spare no pains to
find Lucien and aid him to escape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When will you be out again, monsieur?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This day week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will have everything ready by that time,</q> she said.
<q>You will come as late as you can?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I will come the last thing before we all have to return
to the prison. It will be dark half an hour later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there are sentries on the walls,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but not a large number. The prison is strongly
guarded at night, but not the outer walls; I have often
watched. There is one other thing which I shall want, and
that is a sack in which to put this long box. I carry it,
as you see, full of goods, but to-day I have intentionally
abstained from selling any of them. I will leave the things
with you if you have any place in which to hide them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will put them under my bed,</q> the girl said. <q>My grand’mère
never goes into my room. Besides, she is generally
away at the time you will arrive, and if she is not she will not
hear you go upstairs, as she is very deaf. My father is one of
the warders of the prison, and only comes home once a week.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will then returned to the prison. When the appointed day
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>arrived he put only a few small articles into his box. For
these he paid cash. Then he said good-bye to four or five of
the officers with whom he was most friendly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mad to try to escape,</q> one of them said, <q>there
is no getting over the walls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going to try at any rate. I am utterly sick of this
life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you may be exchanged before long.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is most improbable,</q> he said. <q>Only a few are exchanged
at a time, and as I have not a shadow of influence my
name would not be included in the list.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how are you going to attempt it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now that I must keep to myself. A plan may succeed
once, but may fail if it is tried again. I really think I have
a chance of getting through, but of course I may be caught.
However, I am going to take the risk.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I wish you luck, but I can hardly even hope that
you will succeed.</q>
</p>

<p>
After going about the town as usual, without making any
serious effort to sell his goods, Will made his way, towards the
end of the day, to the house in the lane. Marie was standing
at the door. As he approached she looked anxiously up and
down the street, to be certain that there was no one there, and
then beckoned to him to enter quickly. He obeyed at once,
and she closed the door behind him. <q>Are you sure no one
saw you enter, monsieur?</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>I am quite certain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Marie, <q>you must go at once up to the attic
in case my grand’mère should come in. I have everything
ready for you there. It will be dark in half an hour. I hear
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>the prison bell ringing for the return of the prisoners who are
out, but the roll-call is not made until all have returned to
their cells and are locked up for the night, which will not be
for an hour and a half, so you have plenty of time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you with all my heart, mademoiselle.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went up with her to the attic and looked out at the wall.
The lane was only some twelve feet across, and he was convinced
that he could leap it without difficulty. He emptied
his box and repacked it, selecting chiefly articles which would
take up the smallest amount of room. He made quite sure
how he could best climb from the window to the roof above
it, then he waited with what patience he could until it was
absolutely dark. When he was ready to start he fastened the
rope firmly round the box and said good-bye to Marie.
</p>

<p>
His last words were: <q>I will do my very best for Lucien,
and when the war is over I will send you a gold watch to
wear at your wedding.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then he got upon the window-sill, with the end of the rope
tied round his waist, and with some little difficulty climbed to
the roof of the house, and when he had got his breath began
to pull at the rope and hoisted up the box. He had, before
starting, put on the disguise Marie had bought for him, and
handed her the remains of his uniform, telling her to burn it
at once, and to hide away the buttons for the present, and
throw them away the first time she left the town. <q>There
will be a strict search,</q> he said, <q>for any signs of me, and
those buttons would certainly betray you if they were found.</q>
</p>

<p>
When he got the box up he listened attentively for a little,
and as, to his great joy, he could not hear the footsteps of a
sentinel, he threw it on to the wall and jumped after it. He
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>landed on his feet, and, picking up the box, ran along the wall
till he came to a gun. He tied the end of the rope round this
and slipped down. Then without a moment’s delay he slung
the box over his shoulder and walked away. He had two or
three outworks to pass, but luckily there were no guards, so
he made his way through them without difficulty. All night
he tramped on, and by morning was forty miles away from
Verdun. He did not want to begin to ply his assumed trade
till he was still farther away, so he lay down to sleep in a
large wood. He had saved from his rations during the week
a certain amount of bread, and he had bought a couple of
loaves while wandering with his wares through the town. He
slept for the best part of the day, and started again at night.
Beyond making sure that he was going west he paid but little
attention to the roads he followed, but, keeping steadily in
that direction, he put another forty miles between him and
Verdun by the following morning. Then after a few hours’
sleep he boldly went into a village and entered an inn.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a pedlar,</q> the landlord said, <q>are you not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>I am selling wares manufactured by the
prisoners at Verdun.</q>
</p>

<p>
The news spread and the villagers flocked in to look at these
curiosities.
</p>

<p>
<q>I bought them at a low price, and will sell at the same.
They could not be made by ordinary labour at ten times the
price I charge for them.</q>
</p>

<p>
The bait took, and soon a good many small articles were
sold. Two hours later he again started on his way.

<head>CHAPTER XV</head>

<head type="sub">ESCAPED</head>

<p>
So he travelled across France, avoiding all large towns.
Once or twice he got into trouble with a pompous village
official on account of his not holding a pedlar’s permit; but
the feeling of the people was strong in favour of a man who
was selling goods for the benefit of poor prisoners, and, of
course, he always had some plausible story ready to account
for its absence. At last he came to Dunkirk. He had saved
money as he went, and on his arrival there had eight louis
in his pocket. He took up a lodging at a little cabaret, and,
leaving his box, which was now almost empty, strolled down
to the harbour. Fishing-boats were coming in and going out.
Observing that they were not very well manned, probably
because many of the men had been drafted into the navy, he
selected one which had but four men, a number barely sufficient
to raise the heavy lug-sail, and when she made fast alongside
the quay he went on board.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you want a hand?</q> he said, <q>I am not accustomed to
the sea, but I have no doubt I could haul on a rope as well as
others.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where do you come from,</q> one asked, <q>and how is it
that you have escaped the conscription?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am exempt,</q> he said, <q>as the only son of my mother.
I come from Champagne.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why have you left?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I came away because the girl I was engaged to jilted me
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>for a richer suitor, and I could not stop there to see her
married; I should have cut his throat or my own. So I have
tramped down here to see if I can find some work for a time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a fool for your pains,</q> the skipper said. <q>No
girl is worth it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you never could have been jilted! If you had been
you wouldn’t think so lightly of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, mates, what do you say? Shall we take this young
fellow? He looks strong and active, and I dare say will
suit us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At any rate we can give him a trial for a voyage or two.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you may begin by helping us up into the town with
our fish. We have had a heavy catch to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will at once shouldered a basket and went up with them
to the market-place.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are going to get a drink,</q> the fisherman said. <q>Let
us see how well you can sell for us. You must get a franc a
kilogramme. Here are scales.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a couple of hours Will sold fish, attracting, by his
pleasant face, buyers who might otherwise have passed him;
and when the fishermen returned they were pleased to find
that he had almost sold out their stock, and accounted for his
take to the last sou.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been watching you all the time,</q> the captain said,
<q>though you did not know. I wanted to see if you were
honest, and, now that I have a proof of it, will take you
willingly. The pay is twelve francs a week and a tenth share
in the sales. The boat takes a third, I take two, and the
sailors take one apiece, and you will have half a share besides
your pay till you know your business. Do you agree to that?</q>
</p>

<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Will said.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly he settled down to the work of a fisherman,
and gave great satisfaction. His mates were indeed astonished
at the rapidity with which he learned his work, and congratulated
themselves upon the acquisition of so promising a
recruit.
</p>

<p>
A month after he had joined the smack a ship-of-war was
seen sailing along three miles from shore. The fishermen were
half-way between her and the land, and paid no great attention
to her, knowing that British men-of-war did not condescend
to meddle with small fishing-boats. Will waited until
the captain and one of the men were below; then, suddenly
pushing the hatch to and throwing a coil of rope over it, he
produced from his pockets a brace of pistols which he had
bought at Dunkirk out of the stock of money he had had in
his pocket when he was captured, and ordered the man at the
helm to steer for the frigate. The man let go the tiller at
once, and he and his companion prepared to make a rush upon
Will. But the sight of the levelled pistols checked them.
</p>

  </else></pgIf>
<p>
<q>You will come to no harm,</q> Will said. <q>You have but
to put me on board, and I warrant you shall be allowed to
depart unmolested. I am an English officer. Now, down
with the helm without hesitation, or I will put a bullet
through your head; and do you, Jacques, sit down by his
side.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sullenly the men obeyed his orders, and the boat went
dancing through the water in a direction which, Will calculated,
would enable him to cut off the frigate. In the meantime
the captain and his companion, unable to understand
what was going on, were thumping at the hatchway. Will,
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>however, paid no attention to them, but stood on it, keeping
his eye upon the men in the stern. Twenty minutes brought
them close to the frigate, which, on seeing a small boat making
for her, threw her sails aback to wait for it. As they came
close a rope was thrown; Will grasped it and swung himself
up the side, leaving the boat to drift away. The sailors stood
looking in surprise at him, but Will went straight up to the
first lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg to report myself as having come on board, sir. I
am, or rather was, a midshipman on board the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>. I
have just escaped from Verdun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you really mean it?</q> the lieutenant said. <q>I thought
only one or two English prisoners had ever made their escape
from there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, sir, and I am one of the fortunate ones.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how on earth have you managed to pass right through
France?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was detained three months at Toulon, sir, and there was
allowed to buy some French books. I was then a month on
the way to Verdun, and five months there. During that time
I practised French incessantly, and picked up enough to pass
muster. At last, thanks to a French girl, I succeeded in
getting a disguise and climbing over the wall, and passed
through France as a pedlar with wares made by the
prisoners.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come with me to the captain’s cabin. He will, I am sure,
be glad to hear your story. How were you captured?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the attack the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> made on a battery on one of the
Isles d’Hyères I was shot through the leg and left behind in
the retreat.</q>
</p>

<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, I heard of that affair, and a most unfortunate one it
was. You caught it hot there, and no mistake!</q>
</p>

<p>
The captain listened to the story with great interest, and
then said: <q>Well, Mr. Gilmore, I congratulate you very
heartily on getting out of that terrible prison. I am rather
short of officers, and will rate you as midshipman until I have
an opportunity of sending you home. I have no doubt your
brother officers will manage to rig you out.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant went out with Will and introduced him to
the officers of the ship, to whom he had again to tell the tale
of his adventure. <q>Now come down below to our berth,</q> the
senior midshipman said, <q>and we will see what we can do to
rig you out. We lost one of our number the other day, and I
have no doubt the purser’s clerk will let you take what you
require out of his kit if you give him a bill on your paymaster.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the clothes fitted Will, so he took over the
whole of the effects, as there was sufficient standing to his
account on the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> to pay for them, in addition to the pay
that would accrue during the time of his captivity.
</p>

<p>
He learned that they were on their way to the Texel, where
they were to cruise backwards and forwards to watch the
flotilla of boats that Napoleon was accumulating there for the
invasion of England. It was arduous work, for the heavy
fogs rendered it necessary to use the greatest caution, as there
were many dangerous shoals and currents in the vicinity.
</p>

<p>
One dark night, when they thought that they were in
deep water, the ship grounded suddenly. The tide was
running out, and though they did everything in their power
they could not get her off.
</p>

<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>

<p>
<q>If we have but another couple of hours,</q> the first lieutenant
said, <q>we shall float, as the tide will be turning very
soon. But it is getting light already, and we are likely to
have their gun-boats out in no time.</q>
</p>

<p>
His anticipation turned out correct, for six gun-boats were
soon seen making their way out of the Texel. When within
range they opened fire. The <name type="ship">Artemis</name> replied with such guns
as she could bring to bear on them. She suffered a good deal of
damage, but the tide had turned and was flowing fast. Hawsers
had been run out at the stern and fastened to the capstan,
and the bars were now manned, and the sailors put their whole
strength into the work. At last there was a movement; the
ship quivered from stem to stern, and then slipped off into
deep water. A joyous cheer burst from the crew. But they
did not waste time. They ran at once to their guns, and
opened a broadside fire on the gun-boats. One was disabled
and taken in tow by two others; and the rest, finding themselves
no match for the frigate, sheered off and re-entered the
Texel.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Artemis</name> continued to cruise to and fro for upwards of a
month. One evening the first lieutenant said to Will: <q>The
captain is worried because we were told to expect a messenger
with news as to the state of affairs at Amsterdam and in
Holland generally, and none has arrived. There is no doubt
that they are adding to the number of gun-boats there, and
also to the flat-bottomed boats for the conveyance of troops.
The delay is most annoying, especially as we have orders to
sail for England with the news as soon as we get it, and we
are all heartily sick of this dull and dreary work.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will volunteer to land and communicate with some of
<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>the country-people near Amsterdam,</q> Will said, <q>if the captain
would like it. We know that their sympathies are all with
us, and I have no doubt that I could get what information is
required. If my offer is accepted I should greatly prefer to
go in uniform, for, while I am quite ready to run the risk of
being taken prisoner, I have certainly no desire to be captured
out of uniform, as I should be liable to be hanged as a spy.</q>
</p>

<p>
The first lieutenant mentioned the matter to the captain,
who at once embraced the offer, for he, too, was sick of the
work, in which no honour was to be obtained, and in which
the risks were great, as the coast was a dangerous one. He
sent for Will and said: <q>I hear, Mr. Gilmore, that you are
willing to volunteer to land and gain information. Have you
considered the risks?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know that, of course, there is a certain amount of danger,
sir, but do not consider it to be excessive. At any rate I am
ready to try it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very much obliged to you,</q> the captain said, <q>for we
are all anxious to get away from this place; but mind, I cannot
but consider that the risk is considerable. With our glasses
we constantly see bodies of horsemen riding along the sands,
and have sometimes noticed solitary men, no doubt sentinels;
and it is probably because of them that the messenger we
expected has not been able to put out. I will give you his
address. He lives within half a mile of Amsterdam, in a
house near the shore of the Texel. When are you prepared
to start?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This evening if you wish it, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I think the sooner you go the better. If you land
to-night I will send the boat ashore to the same spot to-morrow
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>night. They will lie off two or three hundred yards, and
come to your whistle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will had no preparations to make for his journey. He received
a letter from the captain authorizing the man to give
every information in his power to the bearer, and with this in
his pocket he took his place in the boat after dark and was
rowed towards the shore. The <name type="ship">Artemis</name> was four miles from
the land when he embarked in the gig, the oars were muffled,
and the men were enjoined to row with the greatest care when
they approached the land. An officer went in charge, and the
<name type="ship">Artemis</name> was to show a light an hour after they started, so
that they could find their way back to her. Will chatted in
a whisper to the officer till they were, he judged, within half
a mile of the land. Then they rowed on in perfect silence till
the keel grated on the sands. At that moment a musket shot
was heard from a sand-hill a couple of hundred yards away.
Will leapt out and ran at full speed for some little distance,
and then threw himself down. The shots were repeated from
point to point, and men ran down to the water’s edge and fired
after the retiring boat.
</p>

<p>
Presently the noise ceased. Whether he had been seen or
not he could not say, but he hoped that, although the sentinel
had made out the boat against the slight surf that broke on
the beach, he had not been able to see him leave it. He got
up cautiously, and, stooping low, moved off until he was quite
certain that he was well beyond the line of sentries. Once
or twice he heard the galloping of parties of men, evidently
attracted by the sound of firing, but none of them came very
near him, and he ran on without interruption. In two hours
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>he saw lights before him, and knew that he was approaching
Amsterdam. He turned to the right, and went on until he
came to a wide sheet of water, which must, he knew, be the
Texel. Then he lay down and slept for some hours. At the
first gleam of dawn he was on his feet again, and made his
way to a farmhouse which exactly agreed with the description
that had been given him. He knocked at the door, and it
was presently opened by a man in his shirt-sleeves.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you Meinheer Johan Van Duyk?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am,</q> the man said. <q>Who are you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am the bearer of this letter from the captain of the
<name type="ship">Artemis</name>, who had expected you to communicate with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come in,</q> the man said. <q>We are early risers here, and
it is advisable that no one should see you. Yes,</q> he went on
when the door was closed, <q>I have been trying to communicate,
but the cordon of sentries along the shore has been so
close, and the watch so vigilant, that it has been quite impossible
for me to come out. I suppose you are an officer of
that ship?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you speak Dutch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I speak French.</q>
</p>

<p>
The man read the letter.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is all right; I can furnish you with all these particulars
when you leave to-night, but of course in that uniform
you must lie dark until then. For some reason or other the
French have suspicions of me, and they have paid me several
visits. Were you seen to land last night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know. They fired on the boat, and I expect
they have a shrewd idea that somebody was put on shore.</q>
</p>

<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>

<p>
<q>In that case,</q> the man said, <q>it is probable that they will
search my house to-day. By this time they know every little
corner of it, so I cannot see where I am to conceal you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I observed a stack behind your house,</q> suggested Will.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there is one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you would at once get a ladder, and take off some
of the thatch and make a hole, I could get into it, and you
could then replace the thatch long before the soldiers are likely
to come out from Amsterdam.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I could do that, and I could hand you in a bottle
of schnapps and some water and bread and meat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That will do very well. I suppose you have men?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I have two, and both of them are true Dutchmen, and
may be trusted. I will give you at once the list of the gun-boats
and flat-boats I have made ready to send on the first
opportunity. I shall be glad to get it out of the house, for,
though it is well hidden, they search so strictly that they
might find it. They broke all my wainscots, pulled up the
flooring, and almost wrecked the house the last time they
came; and I don’t suppose they will be less vigilant this time.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went to the cupboard and brought out some food and
drink.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, sir,</q> he said, <q>if you will eat this I will call up my
two men and set to work at once to get your hiding-place
made, so that you may be safely lodged in it before any people
are about.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will was by no means sorry to take breakfast. He ate the
food leisurely, and just as he had finished Van Duyk came in
to say that the place was ready for him.
</p>

<p>
It was not a large hole, but sufficient to let him lie down at
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>full length under the thatch. He climbed up the ladder the
men had used and got into his nest, and after Van Duyk had
handed him in the provisions he had promised, the two men
set to work with all speed to replace the thatch. It was
made thin, so that he had no difficulty in raising it, and could
even with his finger make a tiny opening through which he
could look. The hay that had been removed to make room
for him was carried away and thrown down in the mangers for
the cows, so that there was nothing to show that the stack had
recently been touched.
</p>

<p>
Two hours later Will heard the trampling of horses, and
two officers, with a troop of cavalry, rode up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I bear a warrant to search your house, Van Duyk,</q> Will
heard one of them say.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have searched it three times already, meinheer, but
you can, of course, search it again if you wish. You will certainly
find no more now than you did then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A spy landed last night, Van Duyk, and it is more than
probable that he is taking shelter here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t know why you should suspect me more than anyone
else. I am a quiet man, meddling in no way with public
matters, and attending only to my own business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is all very well to say that; we have certain information
about you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am well known to my neighbours as a peaceable man,</q>
Van Duyk repeated, <q>and think it monstrous that I should
be so interfered with and harried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we don’t want any talk. Now, men, set to work
and search every corner of the house, not only where a man
could be hidden, but even a paper. These Dutchmen are
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>traitors to a man, and if this fellow is no worse than others he
is at least as bad.</q>
</p>

<p>
For an hour and a half Will, in his hiding-place, heard the
sound of smashing panels and furniture, and the pulling up
of floors. At the end of that time the troopers left the house
and mounted, the officer saying: <q>You have deceived us this
time, old traitor, but we will catch you yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Catch me if you can. I tell you that if you level the
house to the ground you will find nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
After they had ridden off, Van Duyk went out to the haystack.
</p>

<p>
<q>They have gone for the present, meinheer, but you had
better stay where you are. They are quite capable of coming
back again in the hope that you may have come out from some
hiding-place they may have overlooked.</q>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, an hour later the troop galloped up again, only
to find the Dutchman smoking placidly on a seat before his
house. Another search was made, but equally without success,
and then, with much use of strong language, the party rode off.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think you can come down safely now,</q> the Dutchman
said to Will.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, but I don’t wish to run the least risk. I will
remain where I am till it gets dark; I can very well sleep the
time away till then. I sha’n’t get much sleep to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not until it was quite dark did Van Duyk and his men
come with a ladder to remove the thatch again. It took but
a minute to extricate Will from his hole.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will get that filled up and mended before morning,</q>
Van Duyk said. <q>Now, can I let you have a horse?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, thank you, I have but twelve miles to walk. I noted
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>the road as I came, and can find the spot where I landed without
difficulty.</q>
</p>

<p>
With thanks for the Dutchman’s kindness, and handing him
the reward with which the captain had entrusted him, Will
started on his walk. When he approached the spot it was
still four hours from the time at which the boat was to arrive,
and seeing a light in a cottage he went and looked in at the
window. Only a girl and an old woman were there, so he
lifted the latch and went in. <q>I am an English officer,</q> he
said, <q>will you let me sit down by your fire for a couple of
hours? The cold is piercing outside.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old woman answered in broken French, bidding him
welcome, and he sat down and began to talk to her. Her
stock of French was small, and the conversation soon languished.
Presently the girl leapt to her feet and exclaimed
in Dutch: <q>Soldiers!</q> The old woman translated, and Will
then heard the trampling of horses. He jumped up, snatched
a long cloak of the old woman’s from the wall, and threw it
round him. He also took one of her caps that hung there
and put it on his head. It was large, with frills, and almost
covered his face. He had but just time to reseat himself by
the fire and cower over it, as if warming his hands, when the
door opened and a French officer entered. At the sight of the
two apparently old women bending over the fire, and the girl
sitting knitting, he stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam,</q> he said courteously, <q>it is my duty to search
your house. It is believed that a spy who landed here last
night may be returning to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can look,</q> the old woman said in her quavering voice,
<q>as much as you like; you will not find any spy here.</q>
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
As the cottage consisted of only two rooms the search was
quickly effected.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, madam!</q> the French officer said; <q>I am quite
satisfied, and am sorry I have incommoded you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a civil fellow,</q> Will said, as the sound of the
retreating hoofs was heard. <q>Some of these fellows would
have blustered and sworn and turned the whole place upside
down. Well, madam, I am deeply obliged to you for the
shelter you have given me and the risk you have run for my
sake. Here is a guinea; it is all the gold I have with me,
but it may buy some little comfort for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It will buy me enough turf to last me all the winter,</q> the
old woman said. <q>My son is a fisherman who is sometimes
weeks from home, and our supply of turf is running low.
Thank you very much! though I would gladly have done it
without reward, for we all hate the French.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will went out cautiously and made his way down to the
shore, listening at every step for some sound that would tell
of the presence of a sentry. He lay down near the edge of the
sea and watched. At last he saw a dim shape lying stationary
a hundred yards out. He gave a low whistle, but this was
almost instantaneously followed by the report of a musket
within fifty yards of him. He did not hesitate, but with a
shout to the boat ran into the water and struck out towards
it. Another musket was fired, fifty yards to the left, and the
signal was, as before, repeated by sentry after sentry till the
sound died away in the distance. Almost immediately the
galloping of horses could be heard. The boat rowed in to
meet him, and as he scrambled on board a volley of carbines
rang out from the shore. The sailors bent to their oars and,
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>although the firing continued for some time, they knew that
the enemy had lost sight of them. A quarter of an hour later
the sound of oars was heard. <q>Stop rowing,</q> the lieutenant
in command of the boat ordered, <q>and don’t move.</q>
</p>

<p>
In about three minutes a large rowing-boat, manned by
a number of oars, could be made out passing across ahead of
them. The ship’s boat, however, was so small an object in
comparison that it remained unnoticed. They waited till the
beat of oars ceased in the distance and then rowed on again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That was a narrow escape,</q> the lieutenant muttered.
<q>Evidently she was lying in wait to catch you, and if she
had been fifty yards nearer to us she must have made us out.
I think we are safe now, for the course she was taking will
not carry her anywhere near the frigate. At any rate we
have a good start, and I have a lantern here to show in case
we are chased.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had rowed two miles farther when they again heard
the sound of oars.
</p>

<p>
<q>We must row for it now,</q> the lieutenant said. <q>The
frigate is not much more than a mile away.</q>
</p>

<p>
The men bent to their oars, and the lieutenant raised and
lowered his lantern three times. This signal was almost
immediately answered by the boom of a gun from the frigate.
For a time the enemy continued the pursuit, but on a
second gun being fired they ceased rowing.
</p>

<p>
<q>They must know that the frigate can’t see them,</q> the
lieutenant said, <q>but they have no doubt come to the conclusion
that they cannot overtake us before we get to her.
Anyhow it is certain that they have given it up as a bad job.</q>
</p>

<p>
In ten more minutes they were alongside the frigate.
</p>

<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>

<p>
<q>Is Mr. Gilmore with you?</q> a voice asked from above.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am here, sir, safe and sound.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good news,</q> the first lieutenant said, as Will stepped
on deck. <q>The captain was afraid, after he had let you go,
that he had sacrificed you, and that, going as you did in your
uniform, you would be certain to be captured.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir; I had two narrow escapes, but got off all right,
and have brought you the list of gun-boats and row-boats that
you required. I am afraid, though, that it will require careful
opening, for I had to swim off to the boat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That will not matter as long as we can read it,</q> the
lieutenant said. <q>Now you had better come to the captain
and hand it to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am heartily glad to see you, Mr. Gilmore,</q> the captain
said. <q>I have been very uneasy about you, and I really hardly
expected you to return to-night. We knew that the boat
was being chased, by the lights Lieutenant Falcon showed, but
I feared that she was coming back without you. Now tell
me what has happened to you. We knew by the firing that
French sentries saw the boat come to land last night.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will gave a full account of his adventures.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done indeed, Mr. Gilmore! I shall have much
pleasure in reporting your conduct. Now let us examine
the list.</q>
</p>

<p>
The words were a good deal blurred by water, but were
still quite legible.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are stronger in gun-boats than I expected,</q> the
captain said when he had read it. <q>If they had had an ounce
of pluck about them they would have come out and fought us.
A thirty-two-gun frigate is no match for sixteen gunboats.
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>Well, now that we have got this despatch, we can make for
Sheerness at once. Have her headed for that port, Mr. Falcon,
if you please. We won’t lose a moment before making for
England.</q>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI</head>

<head type="sub">A DARING EXPLOIT</head>

<p>
On reaching Sheerness the captain at once went ashore,
accompanied by Will, and they proceeded to London.
Will took up his quarters at the Golden Cross, and next day
called at the Admiralty, where he sent in his name to the First
Lord.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have received a most favourable report from Captain
Knowles of your conduct in landing on the coast of Holland,
and of obtaining despatches of much value. How were
you taken prisoner?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the attack by a force from the <name type="ship">Tartar</name> on some batteries
on one of the Isles d’Hyères. I was hit in the leg, and, being
left behind in the confusion of the retreat, fell into the hands
of the French. I was imprisoned for four months at Toulon,
and then sent to Verdun. Six months after leaving Toulon
I effected my escape in a disguise procured for me by a French
girl. I had learned the language while in prison, and, travelling
through France in the disguise of a pedlar, reached Dunkirk.
There I worked in a fishing-boat for a month, and then,
seeing the <name type="ship">Artemis</name> cruising off the town, I shut up two of the
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>sailors in their cabin, and frightened the other two into taking
me off to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In consideration of the valuable services you have rendered
I have much pleasure in appointing you master’s mate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir! but I own I had rather hopes of obtaining
a lieutenancy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A lieutenancy!</q> the admiral said in a changed tone. <q>I
am surprised to hear you say so, when you have had no
service as a master’s mate. What makes you entertain such
a hope?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My past services, sir,</q> Will said boldly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Captain Purfleet, will you hand me down the volume of
services under the letter G. Ah! here it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
He glanced at it cursorily at first, and then read it carefully.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were right, Mr. Gilmore, in entertaining such a hope.
I see that you have been highly spoken of by the various
officers under whom you have served; that you were most
strongly recommended by the admirals both at Malta and in
the West Indies for your singular services, and also by Lord
Hood for your conduct in Corsica. You were in command
of a small craft for nearly a year, and in that capacity you
not only took a number of prizes, some of them valuable, but
actually captured, in one hard-fought action, two pirates, each
of which was stronger than yourself. You have, therefore,
well shown your capacity to command. Captain Purfleet,
have any appointments been made yet to the <name type="ship">Jason</name>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, then appoint Mr. Gilmore to be second lieutenant
of her. You need not thank me, sir; you owe your commission
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>to your own gallantry and good conduct. I don’t know that
I have at any time seen such strong testimonials and so good
a record for any officer of your age and standing. I am quite
sure that you will do full justice to the appointment that I
have made. As the <name type="ship">Jason</name> will not be ready for two months
I can grant you six weeks leave.</q>
</p>

<p>
No sooner was this matter settled than Will took the coach
to Fairham. Thence he drove to the village of Porchester,
where Marie’s fiancé was confined. Here he put up at a little
inn. He had, before starting from London, bought and put
on the disguise of a countryman, as he could hardly have
stayed in the village as a gentleman without exciting remark
or suspicion. He had, however, brought other clothes with
him, so that if necessary he could resume them, and appear
either as a naval officer or as a civilian. His first step was to
make a tour of the great wall which enclosed the castle and
the huts in which the prisoners were confined. He saw at
once that any attempt to scale the wall would be useless.
At the inn he gave out that by the death of a relative he
had just come into a few pounds and meant to enjoy himself.
</p>

<p>
The inn he had selected was scarcely more than a tavern,
and he had chosen it because he thought it probable that
it would be frequented by the soldiers whose camp stood
near the walls, and who supplied the guards in the castle.
This expectation was fulfilled a short time after his arrival by
four or five soldiers coming in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you drink a glass with me?</q> he said. <q>I have been
telling the landlord that I have come into a little brass, and
mean to spend it.</q>
</p>

<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>

<p>
The soldiers, not unwillingly, accepted the invitation, and
sat down at a table with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be slow work,</q> he said, <q>keeping guard here, and
I expect you would sooner be out at the war.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That we should,</q> one of them replied; <q>there is nothing
to do here but to drill all day, and stare across the water
when we are off duty, and wish we were at Portsmouth,
where there is something to do and something to amuse one.
This is the dullest hole I ever was quartered in. Cosham
on one side and Fairham on the other are the only places
that one can walk to. We expect, however, to be relieved
before long, and I never want to see the place again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose you take recruits here?</q> Will said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh yes, we take recruits when we can get them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How long is a recruit before he begins to be a soldier, and
takes his regular turn as guard and so on?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Two or three months,</q> the man said; <q>that is long enough
to get them into something like shape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like to go in and have a look at the prisoners,</q>
Will said after a little chat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, there is no chance of your doing that,</q> the soldier
replied. <q>Orders are very strict, and only three or four
hucksters are allowed to go in, to sell things to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How many are there of them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>About three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
He chatted for some time, and then, after calling for another
pint of beer all round, sauntered out, leaving the soldiers to
finish it. He saw at once that his only possible plan in the
time he had at his command was either to bribe some of
the guards, which appeared to him too hazardous a plan to
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>adopt, and not likely to lead to success, or to get at one or
other of the people who were allowed in.
</p>

<p>
He spent two days watching the gate of the prison. During
that time five people in civilian dress went in. One of these
was a short fat woman, who carried a large basket with cakes
and other eatables. Another was similarly laden. A third, a
man of about his own height, took in a variety of material
used by the prisoners for making articles for sale. He had
needles and thread, scraps of materials of many colours for
making patchwork quilts, blocks of wood for carving out
model ships, straw dyed various colours for making fancy
boxes, glass beads, and other small articles. Will at once
fixed on him as being the most likely of the visitors to serve
his purpose. He spoke to him after he had left the prison.
</p>

<p>
<q>My friend,</q> he said, <q>do you want to earn fifty pounds?</q>
</p>

<p>
The man opened his eyes in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should certainly like to,</q> he said, <q>if I could see my
way to do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I will double that if you do as I tell you. I want
you, in the first place, to find out the hut in which Lucien
Dupres is confined, and give him a letter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There will be no great difficulty about that,</q> the man
said. <q>I only have to whisper to the first prisoner I meet
that I want to find a man, and have got a letter from his
friends for him, and if he doesn’t know him he will find
him out for me. That is not much to do for a hundred
pounds.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; but in the next place I want you to keep out of the
way for a week, and to lend me your clothes and pass. I
want to go in and see the man.</q>
</p>

<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>

<p>
<q>Well, that is a more dangerous business. How could you
pass for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think I could do that without fear. We are about the
same height. I should have a wig made to imitate your hair,
and should, I imagine, have no difficulty in getting my face
made up so as to be able to pass for you. You must be so well
known that they will do no more than glance at me as I go
in. The only alternative to that will be for you to take to
him a rope and other things I will give you. I tell you
frankly I want to aid his escape. Mind, a hundred pounds is
not to be earned without some slight risk.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of the two things I would rather risk carrying the rope
and the tools, if they are not too bulky. Mind you, it is
a big risk, for I should be liable to be shot for aiding in the
escape of a prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, look here,</q> Will said, <q>I will go into Portsmouth
this afternoon and find some man who can fake me up. There
are sure to be two or three men who make that their business,
for young naval officers are constantly getting into scrimmages,
and must want to have their eyes painted before they
go back on board. Do you go to the prison to-morrow morning.
Find out the man, and deliver this letter to him. Then
come into Portsmouth in the coach. I will be waiting there
till it arrives, and you can go with me, and when I have got
myself made up you shall judge for yourself whether I shall
pass muster for you. There will be no difficulty in getting
whiskers to match yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well,</q> the man said, <q>I will be on the coach to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will at once changed his clothes to an ordinary walking
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>suit, and went into town. On making enquiries he found
that there was a barber who made it his business to paint
black eyes and to remove the signs of bruises. He went to
him and said: <q>I hear you are an artist in black eyes.</q>
</p>

<p>
The man smiled.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don’t look as if you wanted my services, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not in that way, but I suppose you could make up
a face so as to resemble another.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, I was at one time engaged at a theatre in London
in making up the performers, and feel sure that I could accomplish
such a job to your satisfaction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have made a bet,</q> Will said, <q>that I could disguise
myself as a certain man so well that I could take my friends
in. Have you a sandy wig in your shop?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, half a dozen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And whiskers?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have several sets, sir, and I dare say one would be the
right colour.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, then, I will bring the man here to-morrow,
and you shall paint me so as to resemble him as closely as
possible. I don’t mind giving you a five-pound note for the
job.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, if I am not mistaken I can paint you so that
his own mother wouldn’t know the difference.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will took a bed at the George, and at mid-day went to
the inn where the coach stopped. The man was on the
outside.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I have found the Frenchman, and given him the
letter, so that part of the business is done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good. What is the number of the man’s hut?</q>
</p>

<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>

<p>
<q>Number sixty-eight;</q> and the man carefully described its
position.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well. Now we will set about the second part.</q>
</p>

<p>
When they arrived at the shop the barber seated them in
two chairs next to each other, in a room behind the shop, and
set to work at once. He first produced a wig and whiskers,
which, with a little clipping, he made of the size and shape of
the hair on the huckster’s face. Then he set to work with
his paints, first staining Will’s face to the reddish-brown of
the man’s complexion, and then adding line after line. After
two hours’ work he asked them to stand together before a
glass, and both were astonished; the resemblance was indeed
perfect. Will’s eyebrows had been stained a grayish white,
and some long hairs had been inserted so as to give them
the shaggy appearance of the pedlar. A crow’s foot had been
painted at the corner of each eye, and a line drawn from the
nose to the corners of the lips. The chin and lower part of
the cheeks had been tinted dark, to give them the appearance
of long shaving. Both of them burst into a laugh as they
looked at the two faces in the mirror.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will do, sir,</q> the man said. <q>It would need a sharp
pair of eyes to detect the difference between us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I think that will do,</q> Will said, <q>and to aid the
deception I will, as I go in, use my handkerchief and pretend
to have a bad cold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there a basket-maker’s near?</q> Will asked the barber.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, first turning to the right, and first to the left,
two or three doors down, there is a small shop.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I want you at once to go and choose one the size and
shape of your own,</q> Will said to his companion. <q>When
<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>you see one, set the man to work to weave a false bottom
to it. I want it to lodge so as to leave a recess four or five
inches deep. Have it made with two handles, so that it can
be lifted in and out. How long would he be doing it, do you
think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>About an hour and a half, I should say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well; order the man to send it round to the George,
wrapped up in paper, to the address of Mr. Earnshaw. When
you have done this, come back here. We cannot go into the
street together; our singular resemblance would at once be
noticed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> Will said to the pedlar when he returned, <q>meet
me on the road a hundred yards from where it turns down
to Porchester; bring a stock of goods with you, and I will
put them in my basket. Of course you will bring your pass,
and the clothes you now have on in a bundle. I will change
there; as far as I have seen it is very seldom that anyone
passes that way.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will then went for a walk, and when it became quite dark
he took off his wig and whiskers and went into the town
again. Here he bought a long rope, very slender, but still
strong enough to support a man’s weight, and a grapnel which
folded up flat when not in use. Then he went to the George,
having wrapped a muffler round his face as if he were suffering
with toothache. His basket was standing in the <corr sic='hall."'>hall.</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall not return this evening,</q> he said, <q>so I will pay
my bill.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, having bought a suit of ready-made sailor’s clothes,
with hat complete, he put them into his basket, hired a
vehicle, and drove to Fairham. In the morning at nine
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>o’clock he walked along the main road towards Cosham till
he reached the turning to Porchester, went down it a couple
of hundred yards, and sat on a grassy bank till he saw the
pedlar approaching.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a foggy morning,</q> the huckster said when he came
up.
</p>

<p>
<q>So much the better. I hope it will last over to-morrow,
and then they won’t be able to signal the news of the
prisoner’s escape. It is only in clear weather that the
semaphores can be made out from hill to hill.</q>
</p>

<p>
The goods were changed from the pedlar’s basket to the
one Will had brought.
</p>

<p>
<q>There, then, is the hundred pounds I promised you; I
hope you are perfectly satisfied?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perfectly, sir; it is the best two days’ work I have ever
done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now for my clothes,</q> Will said; and no one being in sight
he quickly changed into the clothes the pedlar had brought.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are more alike than ever,</q> the man said with a laugh,
<q>but you will have to remember that I walk with a limp.
I got a ball in my leg in the fighting at Trinidad, and was
discharged as being unfit for service. But I got a small
pension, and the right to sell things to the prisoners in Porchester
Castle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I noticed the limp when I saw you first,</q> Will said, <q>and
there will be no great difficulty in copying it. I regarded it
as rather fortunate, as when the soldiers see me limp along
they will not look farther.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I wish you luck. You are the freest-handed
gentleman I ever came across.</q>
</p>

<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>

<p>
Will hid his own clothes in a neighbouring bush, and
then started, imitating the pedlar’s limp so exactly that
the man laughed as he looked after him before starting for
Fairham.
</p>

<p>
There were few people in the streets of the quiet little
village as Will passed through it. When he neared the castle
he overtook the fat apple-woman, who hailed him as a friend,
and they walked together into the castle. They showed their
passes to the guard at the gate, but he scarcely looked at
them. They then separated, and Will, stopping now and
then to sell small articles, made his way at last to Lucien’s
hut. He had in his letter informed Lucien of his reasons
for trying to get him free, and had directed him to be leaning
at that hour against the corner of the hut. When Lucien saw
the pedlar approaching, if all was clear he was to retire into
it, but if there were others inside he was to shake his head
slightly. As Will approached the hut he saw a prisoner
standing there according to his instructions, but he gave the
danger signal and Will passed on. This he did twice, but
when Will returned the third time the man went quietly into
the hut.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is not a moment to lose,</q> Will said as he followed,
and he at once lifted up the false bottom and pulled out the
rope and grapnel. He had knotted the rope about every foot,
to assist the prisoner in climbing, and had covered the iron
of the grapnel with strips of flannel so that it would make no
noise when it struck the wall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hide them in your bed. It will be a very dark night, and
you must steal out and make your way to the middle of the
south wall. There fling your grapnel up and scale the wall.
<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>I shall be there waiting for you. It looks as if it will be very
wet as well as very dark, so you ought to be able to avoid the
sentinel.</q>
</p>

<p>
At this moment he heard someone at the door, and adroitly
changing his tone said: <q>You do not like these colours for
a bed-quilt? Very well, I am getting a fresh stock from
London in a few days, and I have no doubt you will be
able to suit yourself. Good-morning!</q>
</p>

<p>
He then turned and offered some of his goods to the new-comer,
who bought a block for carving out a ship, and some
twine and other things for rigging her. When he left the
hut he went about the yard till he had disposed of a considerable
amount of his goods, and then left the prison and
made his way back to the spot where he had hidden his clothes.
On arriving there he changed at once, rubbed the pigment
from his face, threw away the wig and whiskers, hid the
basket in a place which he and the pedlar had agreed upon,
with the clothes in it and the pass in one of the pockets,
and then went back into the village, where he hired a chaise
and drove to Fairham.
</p>

<p>
<q>Landlord,</q> he said, as he drew up at the principal hotel,
<q>I shall want a post-chaise to-night for London. I shall be at
a party to-night and cannot say at what time I may get away,
but have the horses ready to put in at twelve o’clock. If they
have to wait an hour or two you shall not be the loser.</q>
</p>

<p>
After ordering dinner, he strolled about the town till he
thought it would be nearly ready. Then he asked for a room,
and there changed into his naval uniform, which he had
brought with him. He ate a good dinner, and then, putting
on his cloak, started to walk back to Porchester, carrying
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>with him a bag in which was the sailor’s suit he had
bought for Lucien. The night was pitch dark, and the rain
had set in heavily, but although his walk was not an agreeable
one he was in high spirits. In his letter to Lucien he
had told him that if anything should prevent him from
making his way to the wall that night he would expect
him on the following one. Nevertheless he felt sure that
in such favourable circumstances he would be able to get
through the sentries without difficulty. He took up a position
as near as he could guess at the centre of the south wall, on
the narrow strip of ground between it and the lake. He had
waited about an hour when he heard a slight noise a few yards
on one side of him. He moved towards the sound, and was
just in time to see Lucien alight. He grasped him by the
hand.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
<q>Thank heaven,</q> he said in French, <q>that I have got you
free, as I promised your sweetheart I would! Now let us first
make our way up the village. I have a suit of sailor’s clothes
for you in this bag; you can change into them when we
get beyond the houses, and throw those you are wearing
into the pond there, with a few stones in them to make them
sink.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, monsieur, how can I thank you?</q> Lucien said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am only paying a debt. Marie risked a good deal to
aid me, and I promised solemnly that I would, if it were
at all possible, get you out of prison in return, so there is
no occasion for any thanks.</q>
</p>

<p>
Few words passed between them as they walked through
the village, and when they had left it behind, Lucien changed
his clothes and disposed of his old ones as Will had suggested.
</p>
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>
<p>
<q>It was necessary to get rid of them,</q> Will said, <q>because
if they were found in the morning it would show that you
had got a change, and instead of looking for someone in
a well-worn uniform they would direct their attention to
other people.</q>
</p>

<p>
They tramped along to Fairham, and reached the hotel just
as it was about to be shut up, the stage-coach having passed
a few minutes before. They had some refreshments, and then
took their seats in the chaise. At once the postilions cracked
their whips, and the four horses started at a gallop.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are absolutely safe now,</q> Will said; <q>they will not
discover that you have gone until the roll-call in the morning,
and by that time we shall be within a few miles of London.
In such weather as this they will be unable to signal. Before
we arrive I will put on civilian clothes again, and as soon as
we have discharged the chaise we will go to a clothier’s and
get a suit for you. There are so many emigrants in London
that your speaking French will attract no attention.</q>
</p>

<p>
The journey was quickly accomplished. Will was very
liberal to the postilions at the first stage, and these hurried
up those who were to take the next, and so from stage to
stage they went at the top of the horses’ speed, the ninety
miles being covered in the very fast time, for the period,
of ten hours. At the last stage Will asked for a room to
himself for a few minutes and there changed his clothes.
They were put down in front of a private house, and, having
seen the post-chaise drive off, took their bags and walked on
until they reached a tailor’s shop.
</p>

<p>
<q>I want to put my man into plain clothes while he is
with me in town,</q> Will said to the shopman.
</p>

<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir. What sort of clothes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, just private clothes, such as a valet might wear when
out of livery!</q>
</p>

<p>
Lucien was soon rigged out in a suit of quiet but respectable
garments, and, putting his sailor suit into his bag, they went on.
They looked about for a considerable time before they found
a suitable lodging, but at last they came upon a French hotel.
Entering, Will asked in French for two rooms. They were at
once accommodated, and after washing and dressing they went
down to the coffee-room, where several French gentlemen were
breakfasting. It had been arranged that Will should say that
they were two emigrants who had just effected their escape
from France.
</p>

<p>
The next day they took the coach to Weymouth, the port
from which at that time communication was kept open with
France by means of smugglers and men who made a business
of aiding the French emigrants who wanted to escape, or
the Royalists who went backwards and forwards trying to get
up a movement against the Republic. On making enquiries
they heard of a man who had a very fast little vessel, and they
at once looked him up. <q>This gentleman wants to go across,</q>
Will said. <q>What would you do it for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It depends whether he will wait till I get some more
passengers or not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is pressed for time,</q> Will said; <q>what will you run
him over for alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fifty pounds,</q> the man said. Will thought it advisable
not to appear to jump at the offer.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is rather stiff,</q> he said; <q>I should think thirty-five
would be ample.</q>
</p>

<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>

<p>
<q>It seems a good sum,</q> the man said; <q>but you see there
are dangers. I might be overhauled by a British cruiser.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You might,</q> Will said; <q>but when they learned your
business they would not interfere with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then there are the port authorities,</q> the man said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but a few francs would prevent them from asking
inconvenient questions. Besides, my friend is not a royalist,
he is only going over to see his friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we will say thirty-five,</q> the man said with a smile.
<q>When will you want to start?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn’t care whether he sails this evening or to-morrow
morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we will say to-morrow morning at daybreak.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where will you land him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Cherbourg or one of the villages near; most likely at
Cherbourg if the coast is clear, for I have friends there who
work with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went to an hotel for the night. In the morning Will
gave Lucien a small package containing a very handsome
gold watch and chain which he had bought in London.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give this to Marie from me,</q> he said; <q>I promised that
she should have one for her wedding-day. Here are a
thousand francs of French money, which will carry you
comfortably from Cherbourg to Verdun and give you a bit
of a start there. No, you need not refuse it, I am a rich
man, and can afford it without in the least hurting myself.
Give my love to Marie,</q> he said, <q>and tell her that I shall
never forget her kindness.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lucien was profuse in his gratitude, but Will cut him short
by hurrying him down to the boat, which was lying at the
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>quay with her sails already hoisted. Will watched the boat
till it was well out to sea, and then took the next coach back
to London, filled with pleasure that he had been able to carry
out his plan and to repay the kindness that Marie had shown
him.
</p>

<p>
He had given Lucien the address of his London agent, so
that on his arrival at Verdun he could write him a letter
saying how he had fared, and when he and Marie were to
be married. This letter he received on his return from the
next cruise. It contained the warmest thanks of Marie and
her lover, and the information that they were to be married
the following week, and that the young man had an offer
of good employment in the town.
</p>

<p>
When he reached London, Will obtained the address of a
respectable solicitor, and called upon him to ask his advice
as to advertising to try to discover a family bearing the arms
on his seal.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should advise you,</q> the lawyer said, <q>to leave the matter
until you return from sea again. Questions of this sort always
require a good deal of time to answer. You would have
to be present to give information, and when the matter is
taken up it should be pressed through vigorously. Of course
there would be difficulties to face. The mere fact of this seal
being in the possession of your father, that is, if he was your
father, would not be sufficient to prove his identity, and there
would be all sorts of investigations to make, which would, of
course, take time. <corr sic="extra quote">If</corr> you will leave the matter in my hands
I will cause enquiries to be made as to the arms. That will
probably only take a day or two, and it would perhaps be a
satisfaction to you to know the family with which you might
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>be connected. It will be in the subsequent steps that delays
will occur.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir! I should certainly like to know, though
I quite see that, as you say, it will be very difficult for me
to establish my connection.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lawyer then took down what particulars Will could
give him of his early history. When he returned a week
later the lawyer gave him a cordial reception.
</p>

<p>
<q>I congratulate you, Mr. Gilmore,</q> he said. <q>The head of
the family carrying those arms is Sir Ralph Gilmore, one of our
oldest baronets. He has no male issue. He had one son who
died six years ago. There was another son, a younger one, of
whom there is no record. He may be alive and he may be
dead; that is not known. It is, of course, possible that you
were stolen as a child by your reputed father, and that he
gave you the family name in order that when the time came
he could produce you, but of course that is all guesswork.
When you return from sea again I will set people to work to
trace, if possible, the wanderings of this person; but as I said,
this will take time, and as you will be going to sea in a fortnight
the matter can very well stand over. So long as you
are on board a ship your parentage can make very little
difference to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will had still a fortnight of his leave remaining. He
wandered about London for a couple of days, but he found
it rather dull now that he had finished his business, as he
had no friends in town. On the second day he was walking
along one of the fashionable streets of Bloomsbury,
considering whether he should not go down by the next
coach to Portsmouth, where he was sure of meeting friends,
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>when a carriage passed him, drawn by a pair of fine horses.
A young lady who was sitting in it happened to notice him.
She glanced at him carelessly at first, and then with great
interest. She stopped the carriage before it had gone many
yards, and when Will came up, looked at him closely. <q>Excuse
me, sir,</q> she said as he was passing; <q>but are you not
Mr. Gilmore?</q> Greatly surprised he replied in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought so!</q> she exclaimed. <q>Do you not remember
me?</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked at her hard. <q>Why—why,</q> he hesitated,
<q>surely it is not—</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it is!</q> she cried. <q>I am Alice Palethorpe!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Miss Palethorpe!</q> he exclaimed, grasping the hand she
held out. <q>Is it possible?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not Miss Palethorpe,</q> she said. <q>To you I am Alice,
as I was nearly four years ago. Get into the carriage. My
father will be delighted to see you. We have talked of you
so often. He made enquiries at the Admiralty when he came
home, but found that you were a prisoner in France, and he
has been trying to get your name down in the list of those
to be exchanged, but he had so little interest that he could not
succeed, and, indeed, for the past two years no exchange had
taken place.</q>
</p>

<p>
By this time he was in the carriage, and they were driving
rapidly along the busy streets. Presently they stopped before
a large house in Bedford Square.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is our home, for the present at any rate,</q> she said.
<q>Now come in.</q>
</p>

<p>
She ran upstairs before him and signed to him to wait at the
<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>top. <q>Father,</q> she said, bursting into a room, <q>I have taken
a captive; someone you certainly don’t expect to see. Now,
you must guess.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I, my dear, when you say I don’t expect to see
him? Is it—?</q> and he mentioned five or six of his friends in
Jamaica, any of whom might be returning.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, father. You are out altogether.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I give it up, Alice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is Will,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
Will heard him spring to his feet and hurry to the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear young friend!</q> he exclaimed. <q>At least I
suppose it is you, for you have grown out of all recognition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, father!</q> the girl broke in. <q>You see, he hadn’t
changed so much as to deceive me. I felt sure of him the
moment I set eyes upon him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, your eyes do you credit,</q> her father said.
<q>Certainly I should not have recognized him. He has grown
from a lad into a man since we saw him last. He has widened
out tremendously. He was rather one of the lean <anchor id="corr319"/><corr sic="kine">kind</corr> at that
time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, father, how can you say so? I consider that he was
just right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my dear, I quite understand that. At that time he
was perfect in your eyes, but for all that he was lean.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite right, sir, I was, and I really wonder that
I have put on flesh so much. The diet of a French prisoner
is not calculated to promote stoutness. But your daughter
was not only sharper-sighted than you, but even than myself.
Till she spoke to me I had not an idea who she was. I saw
that she thought she recognized me, but I was afraid it would
<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>be rude on my part to look at her closely. Of course now I
do see the likeness to the Alice I knew, but she has changed
far more than I have. She was a little girl of fourteen then,
very pretty, certainly, I thought, but still quite a girl—</q> and
he stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, you mean that I have grown into a young woman,
and have lost my prettiness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think your looking-glass tells you another story,</q> he
laughed. <q>If it doesn’t, it must be a very bad one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now, do sit down,</q> her father said. <q>You must
have an immense deal to tell us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a longish story,</q> Will replied, <q>too long to tell
straight off. Besides, I want to ask some questions. When
did you come home? Have you come for good? If not, how
long are you going to stay? though I am sorry to say that the
length of your visit can affect me comparatively little, for
I am appointed second-lieutenant of the <name type="ship">Jason</name>, and must join
in a few days.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I congratulate you very heartily, Will,</q> Mr. Palethorpe
said. <q>You are fortunate indeed to get such promotion so
early.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am most fortunate, sir. Though just at present I feel
inclined to wish that it hadn’t come quite so soon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In answer to your question, Will, I can say that we are
home for good. I have disposed of my estate and wound up
my business, principally, I think, because this little girl had
made up her mind that she should like England better than
Jamaica.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to hear that, sir. I shall have something to
look forward to when I return to England.</q>
</p>

<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>

<p>
<q>Where are you staying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the Golden Cross.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, you must go and fetch your luggage here at
once. It would be strange indeed if you were to be staying
at any house but mine while you are in London.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he saw that the planter would not hear of a refusal, Will
gladly accepted the invitation, and, taking a fly, drove to the
hotel, paid his bill, and took his things away.

<head>CHAPTER XVII</head>

<head type="sub">ON BOARD THE <q>JASON</q></head>

<p>
<q>I won’t ask you for your story till after dinner,</q> Mr.
Palethorpe said. <q>To enjoy a yarn one needs to be
comfortable, and I feel more at home in my arm-chair in the
dining-room than I do in this room, with all its fal-lals. You
see, I have taken the house furnished. When I settle down
in a home of my own, I can assure you it will look very
different from this. In fact I have one already building for
me. It is at Dulwich, and will be as nearly as possible like
my house in Jamaica. Of course there will be differences.
I at first wished to have the same sort of veranda, but the
architect pointed out that while in Jamaica one requires
shade, here one wants light. So they are getting large
sheets of glass specially made for putting in instead of wood
above the windows. Then, of course, we want good fireplaces,
whereas in Jamaica a fire is only necessary for a few
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>days in the year. There are also other little differences, but
on the whole it will remind me of the place I had for so many
years.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The house will have one advantage over that in Jamaica,
Mr. Palethorpe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is that?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will be able to go to bed comfortably without fear
of having the roof taken from over your head by a hurricane.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! that is indeed a matter to which I have not given
sufficient consideration, but it is certainly a very substantial
advantage, as we have all good reason to know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never think of it without shuddering,</q> Alice said. <q>It
was awful! It seemed as if there was an end of everything!
I think it was the memory of that night that first set me
thinking of going to England.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I cannot but feel grateful to that hurricane, for if
you had remained out there it is probable that I should never
have met you again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am having a large conservatory built so that we can have
greenness and flowers all the year,</q> Mr. Palethorpe remarked
presently.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think that would be charming. I hope you will
be settled at Dulwich long before I come back from my next
cruise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I don’t know that I can say the same, Will. I hope
your next cruise will be a short one.</q>
</p>

<p>
When dinner was over, the chairs were drawn up to the fire,
and Will related his adventures since his return from the
West Indies.
</p>

<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>

<p>
<q>Have you heard of your two favourite sailors?</q> Alice
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dimchurch and Tom Stevens? No, I have not. I shall
feel lost without them at sea, and sincerely hope that I may
some day run against them, in which case I am sure, if they
are free, they will join my ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How terribly cut up they must have been,</q> the girl said,
<q>when they got down to the beach and found that you were
missing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure they would be,</q> he replied. <q>I expect the rest
of the men almost had to hold them back by force.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, go on. You were hit and made prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will went on with his story till he came to his escape from
Verdun.
</p>

<p>
<q>What was she like?</q> the girl asked. <q>I expect she was
very pretty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not particularly so. She was a very pleasant-looking
girl.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can imagine she seemed very pleasant to you,</q> the girl
laughed; <q>and, of course, before you got out of the window
and climbed to the top of the house you kissed her, didn’t
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did,</q> Will said. <q>Of course she expected to be
kissed. I am not at all used to kissing. In fact, I only experienced
it once before, and then I was a perfectly passive
actor in the affair.</q>
</p>

<p>
The girl flushed up rosily.
</p>

<p>
<q>You drew that upon yourself, Alice,</q> her father said.
<q>If you had left him alone he would not have brought up that
old affair.</q>
</p>

<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>

<p>
<q>I don’t care,</q> she said. <q>I was only thirteen, and he had
saved my life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You didn’t do it again, my dear, I hope, when you met
him in the street to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course not!</q> she exclaimed indignantly. <q>The idea of
such a thing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, let this be a lesson to you not to enquire too
strictly into such matters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I will bear it in mind,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can assure you, Alice, that it was a perfectly friendly
kiss. She was engaged to be married to a young soldier who
was a prisoner at Porchester, and during the past week I have
been employed in setting him free, as you will hear presently.
I promised her I would do so if possible, and of course I kept
my word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What! you, an English officer, set a French prisoner free!
I am shocked!</q> Mr. Palethorpe said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would have tried to set twenty of them free if twenty
of their sweethearts had united to get me away from prison.</q>
</p>

<p>
They laughed heartily at the story of his escape as a pedlar,
and were intensely interested in his account of the manner
in which he succeeded in getting a despatch from the agent
of the British Government at Amsterdam. He continued the
narrative until his arrival in England.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now we shall hear, I suppose, how this British officer perpetrated
an act of treason against His Most Gracious Majesty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I suppose it was that in the eyes of the law,</q> Will
laughed. <q>Fortunately, however, the law has no cognizance of
the affair, at any rate not of my share in it. I don’t suppose it
has been heard of outside Porchester. As His Gracious Majesty
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>has some forty thousand prisoners in England, the loss of one
more or less will not trouble his gracious brain.</q>
</p>

<p>
He then related the whole story of Lucien’s escape.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have liked to see you dressed up like a pedlar,
with your face all painted, and a wig and whiskers,</q> the girl
said, <q>though I don’t suppose I should have recognized you in
that disguise to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was a capitally-managed plan, Will, and had it been
for a legitimate object I should have given it unstinted praise.
And so you saw him fairly off from England?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; and by this time I have no doubt he is on the top of
a vehicle of some sort, going as fast as horses can gallop to
join his sweetheart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wonder,</q> Alice said mischievously, <q>whether she will
ever tell him of that kiss at the window.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say she will,</q> laughed Will, <q>but perhaps not till
they are married. I sent her the gold watch I promised her,
and when she holds it up before his eyes I think he won’t
grudge her the kiss. Still, I believe these things are not
always mentioned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I suppose not,</q> she said, with an affectation of not
understanding him. <q>Why should they be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can’t say indeed, if you can’t.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am not ashamed of it one little bit, though I own
that I never have told anybody. But I don’t see why I
shouldn’t. I am sure there were at least half a dozen ladies
in Jamaica who would willingly have kissed you for what you
did for them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you! I should certainly not have willingly submitted
to the ordeal.</q>
</p>

<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>

<p>
It was late when the story was finished, and they soon
afterwards went to bed.
</p>

<p>
Will spent a delightful week with his friends. Alice had
grown up into a charming young woman, full of life and
vivacity, and even prettier than she had promised to be as a
girl. They went about together to all the sights of London,
for Mr. Palethorpe said that he didn’t care about going, and
young people were best left to themselves. When the time
came for parting, Will for the first time experienced a feeling
of reluctance at joining his ship. He and Alice were now
almost on their old footing, and Will thought that she was by
far the nicest girl he had ever seen; but it was not until he
was on the top of the Portsmouth coach that he recognized
how much she was to him. <q>Well,</q> he said to himself, <q>I
never thought I should feel like this. Some young fellows are
always falling in love. I used to think it was all nonsense,
but now I understand it. I do not know why her father
should object to me, as I am fairly well off. I must see as
much of her as I can when I land next time. I hope she
won’t meet anyone in the meantime she likes better.</q>
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Jason</name> was now lying out in the harbour, and the riggers
had taken possession of her. Will at once reported himself
and went on board. The other officers had not yet joined,
but he at once took up his work with his usual zeal, and spent
a busy fortnight looking after the riggers, and seeing that
everything was done in the best manner. He was, however,
somewhat angry to find that Alice’s face and figure were constantly
intruding themselves into the cordage and shrouds.
<q>I am becoming a regular mooncalf,</q> he said angrily to himself.
<q>It is perfectly absurd that I can’t keep my thoughts
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>from wandering away from my work, and for a girl whom I
can hardly dare hope to win. I shall be very glad when we
are off to sea. I’ll then have, I won’t say something better, but
something else to think of. If this is being in love, certainly
it is not the thing a sailor should engage in. I have often
heard it said that a sailor’s ship should be his wife, and I have
no longer any doubt about it. But I know I’ll get over it
when I hear the first broadside fired.</q>
</p>

<p>
A week later the first lieutenant joined. His name was
Somerville.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Mr. Gilmore,</q> he said, <q>I see you have taken time by
the forelock and given an eye to everything! I only received
my appointment two days ago or I should have joined before.
There is nothing like having an officer to superintend things,
and I feel really very much obliged to you for not having
extended your leave, which, of course, you could have done,
especially as, so far as I know, no boatswain has yet been
appointed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was glad to get back to work, sir, and it is really
very interesting seeing all the rigging set up from the very
beginning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, but for all that men don’t generally want to
rejoin,</q> the first lieutenant said with a smile. <q>The difficulty
is to get young officers on board. They hang back, as a rule,
till the very last moment. Well, if you will dine with me
this evening, Mr. Gilmore, at the George, I shall be glad to
hear of some of your services. That they are distinguished I
have no doubt, for nothing but the most meritorious services
or extraordinary interest could have gained you at your age
the appointment of second lieutenant in a fine ship like this. I
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>think it a very good thing for the first lieutenant to know the
antecedents of those serving with him. Such knowledge is very
useful to him in any crisis or emergency.</q>
</p>

<p>
After dinner that evening Will gave an account of his services,
the lieutenant at times asking for more minute details,
especially of the capture of the two pirates.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much!</q> Lieutenant Somerville said when
he had finished. <q>Now I feel that I can, in any emergency,
depend upon you to second me, which I can assure you is by
no means commonly the case, for promotion goes so much by
influence, and such incapable men are pushed up in the service
that it is a comfort indeed to have an officer who knows
his work thoroughly. I hope to goodness we shall have the
captain so fine a ship deserves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope so indeed, sir. I have hitherto been extremely
fortunate in having good captains, as good as one could wish
for.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are fortunate indeed, then. I have been under two
or three men who, either from ignorance or ill-temper or sheer
indifference, have been enough to take the heart entirely out
of their officers.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the day when the <name type="ship">Jason</name> was ready for commission the
captain came down to Portsmouth and put up at the George,
and Mr. Somerville and Will called upon him there. He was
a young man, some years younger than the first <corr sic='lieutenant."'>lieutenant.</corr>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he began, <q>I have pleasure in making your
acquaintance. I saw the admiral this morning, and he assured
me that I could not wish for better officers. I hope we shall
get on pleasantly together, and can assure you that if we do
not it will not be my fault. We have as fine a ship as men
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>could wish to sail in, and I will guarantee that you will not
find me slack in using her. As you may guess by my age, I
owe my present position partly to family interest, but my
object will be to prove that that interest has not been altogether
misplaced. I have already had command of a frigate,
and we had our full share of hard service. I am afraid that
with a seventy-four we shall not have quite so many opportunities
of distinguishing ourselves, but shall generally have
to work with the fleet and fight when other people bid us,
and not merely when we see a good chance. There is, however,
as much credit, if not as much prize-money, to be gained
in a pitched battle as in isolated actions. I was kindly permitted
by the admiral to read both your records of service,
and I cannot say how gratified I was to find that I had two
such able and active officers to second me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure we are much obliged to you, sir,</q> Lieutenant
Somerville replied, <q>for speaking to us as you have done. I
can answer for it that we will second you to the very best of
our power, and I am glad indeed to find that we have a commander
whose sentiments so entirely accord with our own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, gentlemen, we have done with the formalities. Let
us crack a bottle of wine together to our better acquaintance,
and I hope I shall very often see you at my table on board,
for while I feel that discipline must be maintained, I have
no belief in a captain holding himself entirely aloof from his
officers, as if he were a little god. On the quarter-deck a
captain must stand somewhat aloof, but in his own cabin I
cannot see why he should not treat his officers as gentlemen
like himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
They sat and chatted for an hour, and when they left,
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>Lieutenant Somerville said to Will: <q>If I am not much
mistaken, we shall have a very pleasant time on board the
<name type="ship">Jason</name>. I believe Captain Charteris means every word he says,
and that he is a thoroughly good fellow. He has a very
pleasant face, though a firm and resolute one, and when he
gives an order it will have to be obeyed promptly; but he is
a man who will make allowances, and I do not think the cat
will be very often brought into requisition on board.</q>
</p>

<p>
One day Will was sauntering down the High Street when
he saw two country-looking men coming along. One of them
looked at him and staggered back in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> he exclaimed, <q>it is Mr. Gilmore! We thought
you were in prison in the middle of France, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So I was, Dimchurch; but, as you see, I have taken leg-bail.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was a terrible affair, sir, at them French batteries.
When I got down to the shore, and found you were missing,
it was as much as they could do to keep Tom here and me
from going back. You mayn’t believe me, Mr. Gilmore, but
we both cried like children as we rowed to the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am indeed glad to see you again, and you too, Tom.
I guessed that if I ever came across the one I should meet the
other also. What are you doing in those togs?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, we put them on because we did not want to be
impressed by the first ship that came in, but preferred to
wait a bit till we saw one to suit us. I see, sir, that you have
shipped a swab. That means, of course, that you have got a
lieutenancy. I congratulate you indeed, sir, on your promotion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I got it a month ago, and to a fine ship, the <corr sic="no quote"><name type="ship">Jason</name>.</corr></q>
</p>

<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>

<p>
<q>She is a fine ship, sir, and no mistake. Tom and I were
watching her lying out in the harbour yesterday, and were
saying that, though we have always been accustomed to
frigates, we should not mind shipping in her if we found out
something about the captain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I can tell you, Dimchurch, that he is just the man
you would like to serve under, young and dashing, and, I
should say, a good officer and a fine fellow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And who is the first lieutenant, sir, because that matters
almost as much as the captain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a good fellow too, Dimchurch, a man who loves his
profession and has a good record.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And who is the second, sir? not that it matters much
about him if the captain and first luff are all right. I suppose
she has four on board, as she is a line-of-battle ship?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she carries four. As to the second, I can only tell
you that he is one of the finest fellows in the service, and you
will understand that when I say that I am the second lieutenant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, sir!</q> Dimchurch almost shouted, <q>they have made
you second lieutenant on a line-of-battle ship! Well, that is
one of the few times I have known promotion go by merit.
I am glad, sir. Well, I will go and sign articles at once, and
so, of course, will Tom; and what is more, I will guarantee to
find you a score of first-rate hands, maybe more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good indeed,</q> Will said. <q>I will speak to the
first lieutenant and get you rated as boatswain, if possible.
You have already served in that capacity, and unless the
berth is filled up, which is not likely, I have no doubt I can
get it for you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, if you can, of course I shall be glad; but I would
ship with you if it was only as loblolly boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The same here,</q> Tom said; <q>you know that, sir, without
my saying it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there any berth that I could get you, Tom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir, thank you! A.B. is good enough for me. I am
not active enough to be captain of the top, but I can pull
on a rope, or row an oar, or strike a good blow, with any
man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That you can, Tom; but I do wish I could get you a lift
too. How about gunner’s mate?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, thank you, sir! I would rather stop A.B. I should
like to be your honour’s servant, but, lor’, I should never do to
wait in the ward-room. I am as clumsy as a bear, and should
always be spilling something, and breaking glasses, and getting
into trouble. No, sir, I will be A.B., but of course I should
like to be appointed to your boat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a matter of course, Tom. Well, I will go round
to the dockyard at once and see you sworn in, and then
gladden the first lieutenant’s heart by telling him that you
will bring a good number of men along with you, for at
present we are very short-handed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You trust me for that, sir. I know where lots of them
are lying hid, not because they don’t want to serve, but
because they want a good ship and a good captain. When I
tell them that it is a fine ship, and a good captain, and a good
first and second, they will jump at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dimchurch was as good as his word, and the following week
persuaded thirty first-class seamen to sign on.
</p>

<p>
<q>At the same time, sir,</q> he said as they went towards
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>the harbour, <q>I would rather she had been a frigate. One
has always a chance of picking up something then, as one
gets sent about on expeditions, while on a battle-ship one is
just stuck blockading.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is just what I think,</q> Tom said. <q>There are no
boat expeditions, no chances of picking up a prize every two
or three days, or of chasing a pirate. Still, though the <name type="ship">Tartar</name>
was a frigate, we did not have much fun in her, except when
we were on shore. That was good enough, though it would
not have been half so good if the sailors had not done it alone.
We wanted to show these redcoats what British seamen could
do when they were on their metal. I know I never worked
half so hard in my life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I quite agree with you. It is more pleasant commanding
a small craft than being second officer in a large one,
although I must say I could not have had a more pleasant
captain and first lieutenant than I have now if I had picked
them out from the whole fleet. I am sorry that I cannot get
leave at present, for I want to make researches about my
father. According to what my lawyer said it is likely to be
a long job. I hope, however, to get it well in trim on my
next spell ashore. It makes really no difference to me now
who or what my father was. I have a good position, and
what with the prize-money I made before, and shall gain now
by my share of the sale of the frigates we took at Corsica, to
say nothing of the guns and stores we captured, I have more
than enough to satisfy all my wants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have done extraordinarily well too, Mr. Gilmore,</q> Dimchurch
said. <q>I took your advice, and Tom and I have put
all our prize-money aside. He has over a thousand saved, and
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>I have quite sufficient to keep me in idleness all my life,
even if I never do a stroke of work again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Somerville, on Will’s recommendation, at once appointed
Dimchurch boatswain, and he soon proved himself
thoroughly efficient. <q>He is a fine fellow, that sailor of yours,</q>
the lieutenant said, <q>and will make a first-rate boatswain.
He has done good service in bringing up so many hands, and
good ones too, and he is evidently popular among the men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a thoroughly good man, sir. He attached himself
to my fortunes when I was but a ship’s boy, and has stuck to
me ever since. He and Tom Stevens are, with one exception,
the greatest friends I have ever had, and both of them would
lay down their lives for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A good master makes a good man,</q> Lieutenant Somerville
said with a smile. <q>Your greatest friend was, of course, the
lady who pushed you on with your education.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, certainly I regard her as the best friend I ever
had.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, there is no better friend for a lad than a good
woman, Gilmore. In that sense my mother was my greatest
friend. Most mothers are against their sons going to sea. In
my case it was my father who objected, but my mother, seeing
how I was bent upon it, persuaded him to let me go.</q>
</p>

<p>
Three weeks after being commissioned the complement of
the <name type="ship">Jason</name> was complete, and she was ordered to proceed to
the West Indies, to which place they made a fast passage. To
their disappointment they fell in with none of the enemy’s
cruisers on their way. The voyage, however, sufficed to give
the crew confidence in their commander. He was prompt
and quick in giving orders, and at the same time pleasant in
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>manner. He paid far more attention than most captains to
the comfort of his crew, and, while he insisted upon the most
perfect order and discipline, abstained from giving unnecessary
work. In cases where punishments were absolutely necessary
he punished severely, but when it was at all possible he let
delinquents off with a lecture. So, while he was feared by
the rougher spirits of the crew, he was regarded with liking
and respect by the good men.
</p>

<p>
On their arrival at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, they found that
they were in time to join a naval expedition whose object was
to recover the islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada,
which had been captured by the French the previous year.
</p>

<p>
A fleet had been sent from England under the command of
Rear-admiral Christian, consisting of two ships of the line and
five frigates, convoying a large fleet of transports with a strong
body of troops on board under the command of Sir Ralph
Abercrombie.
</p>

<p>
At Carlisle Bay this fleet were joined by most of the ships
on the West Indian station, and on the 21st April, 1796, the
augmented fleet, under the command of Sir John Laforey,
sailed to Marin Bay, Martinique, where they anchored. On
the following day Sir John Laforey resigned his command to
Admiral Christian and sailed for England. The fleet then
stood across to St. Lucia. The troops were landed at three
different points under the protection of the guns of the fleet.
</p>

<p>
The first point was protected by a five-gun battery. The
fire of the ships, however, soon silenced it, and the first division
made good its landing. The seventy-four-gun ship <name type="ship">Alfred</name>
was to have led the second division, supported by the fifty-four-gun
ship <name type="ship">Madras</name> and the forty-gun frigate <name type="ship">Beaulieu</name>, but
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>the attempt was thwarted by lightness of wind and a strong
lee current. On the next day, however, a landing was effected
with little opposition. Eight hundred seamen, under the
command of Captains Lane of the thirty-two-gun frigate <name type="ship">Astrea</name>
and Ryves of the bomb-vessel <name type="ship">Bulldog</name>, were landed to co-operate
with the troops. Morne Chabot was attacked and carried
that night with the loss of thirteen officers and privates killed,
forty-nine wounded, and twelve missing.
</p>

<p>
On the 3rd of May an attempt was made to dislodge the
enemy from their batteries at the base of the mountains, but
was repulsed with loss, as was an attack on the 17th on the
place called Vigie.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the men had been busy building batteries
and planting guns, and when these opened fire on the evening
of the 24th of May the enemy capitulated, two thousand
marching out and laying down their arms. A great quantity
of guns, together with stores of every description, were found
in the different forts, and some small privateers and merchantmen
were captured in the offing. Eight hundred seamen and
three hundred and twenty marines had been landed from the
ships of war, and had behaved with their usual courage and
promptitude. The manner, indeed, in which they established
batteries and planted guns in places deemed almost impracticable
astonished the troops, unused as they were to exercises
demanding strength and skill.
</p>

<p>
As soon as St. Lucia had surrendered, the expedition moved
to St. Vincent. The defence here was decidedly weak, and
after some skirmishing, the enemy, composed chiefly of negroes
and Caribs, capitulated. Our loss amounted to thirty-eight
killed and one hundred and forty-five wounded. Grenada
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>offered a comparatively slight resistance. The monster, Fedon,
who was in command there, massacred twenty white people
who were in his power in full view of the British, who were
on the plain below. He and his men, however, were hotly
pursued through the forest by a detachment of German riflemen,
and the greater portion of them killed without mercy.
</p>

<p>
A detachment of British and colonial troops from the garrison
of Port au Prince in St. Domingo proceeded to besiege
the town of Leogane in that island. Covered by the guns of
the fleet the troops were landed in two divisions, while the
<name type="ship">Swiftsure</name>, seventy-four, cannonaded the town, and the <name type="ship">Leviathan</name>
and <name type="ship">Africa</name> the forts. The place, however, was too strong
for them, and at nightfall the ships moved off to an anchorage,
while those who had landed were withdrawn on the following
morning. Two of the frigates were so much damaged that
they were compelled to return to Jamaica to refit. An attack
was next made upon the fort of Bombarde, which stood at a
distance of fifteen miles from the coast. Will and a detachment
from his ship formed part of the force engaged. The
road was extremely rough, and was blocked by fallen trees
and walls built across it. The labour of getting the cannon
along was prodigious.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must say,</q> Will said to Dimchurch, who was one of the
party, <q>I greatly prefer fighting on board to work like this.
We have to labour like slaves from early morning till late in
the evening; but I don’t so much mind that, as the fact that
at night we have to lie down with only the food that remains
in our haversacks, and what water we may have saved, for
supper. Now in a fight at sea one at least gets as much to
drink as one wants.</q>
</p>

<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>

<p>
<q>I quite agree with you, Mr. Gilmore. It’s dog’s work
without dog’s food. I don’t mind myself working here with a
chopper eight or ten hours a day, but I do like a good supper
at the end of it. The worst of it is, that when it is all over
it is the troops who get all the credit, while we poor beggars
do the greater part of the work. The soldiers are well
enough in their way, but they are very little good for hard
work. How do you account for that, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can only suppose, Dimchurch, that while they get as
much food as we do, they have nothing like the same amount
of hard work to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That’s it, sir. Why, look at them at Portsmouth! They
just go out of a morning and drill on the common for a bit,
and then they have nothing else to do all day but to stroll
about the town and talk to the girls. How can you expect
a man to have any muscle to speak of when he never does
a stroke of hard work? I don’t say they don’t fight well, for
I own they do their duty like men in that line; but when it
comes to work, why, they ain’t in it with a jack-tar. I do
believe I could pull a couple of them over a line.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say you could, Dimchurch, but you must remember
that you are much stronger than an ordinary seaman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, I grant I am stronger than usual, but I should be
ashamed of myself if I could not tackle two of them soldiers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but don’t forget they have been cooped up on board
a ship for a month, with nothing to keep them in health, and
certainly no exercise, while you are constantly doing hard
work. If you were to put these men into sailors’ clothes, and
give them sailors’ work for six months, they would be just as
strong and useful.</q>
</p>

<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, if they are that sort of men why do they go
and enlist in the army instead of becoming sailors. It stands
to reason that it is because they know that they cannot do
work.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, Dimchurch, I have heard that in the great towns
girls think as much of soldiers as of sailors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that shows how little they know about them. In a
seaport, what girl would look at a soldier if she were pretty
enough to get a sailor for a sweetheart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a prejudiced beggar,</q> Will laughed, <q>and it is of
no use arguing with you. If you had gone as a soldier instead
of taking to the sea you would think just the other way.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the next morning the march was renewed, and in the
evening they reached the fort. They had had several severe
skirmishes during the day, losing eight killed and twenty-two
wounded, but the garrison, consisting of three hundred, surrendered
without further resistance as soon as the place was
surrounded, and the sailors then rejoined their ships.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am mighty glad I am back on board,</q> Dimchurch
said to Will the evening they re-embarked. <q>This marching,
and chopping trees, and being shot at from ambushes, doesn’t
suit me. There is nothing manly or straightforward about it.
Hand to hand and cutlass to cutlass is what I call a man’s
work.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is all very well, Dimchurch, but though you may
capture ships you will never get possession of islands or
colonies in that way. If you want them you must land and
fight for them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, that is all very good, but it seems to me that the
hard work of making batteries and mounting guns falls on the
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>sailor, while the soldier gets all the credit. It is not our
admiral who sends the despatches, it is the general. He may
speak a few good words for the sailors, as a man speaks up
for a dog, but all the credit of the fighting, and the surrender,
and all that business goes to the soldiers. The sooner we sail
away from here, and do some fighting nearer home, where
there are no soldiers, and where the sailors get their due, the
better pleased I shall be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Dimchurch, I hope our turn out here is nearly
finished. We may have to take part in a few more attacks
on French possessions, but as soon as that work is over I
have great hopes that we shall get sailing orders for home
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, late in August a fast cruiser arrived with orders
that the <name type="ship">Jason</name> was at once to return to Brest and join the
Channel fleet. To the great delight of everyone the wind
continued favourable throughout the whole voyage, and after
an exceptionally speedy passage they joined Admiral Bridport,
who was cruising off Ushant on the look-out for the French
fleet that was preparing for the invasion of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
The French fleet, under Admiral Morard-de-Galles, got
under weigh from Brest on 26th December, 1796. It consisted
of seventeen ships of the line, thirteen frigates, six
corvettes, seven transports, and a powder-ship, forty-four sail
in all, conveying eight thousand troops under the command of
Generals Grouchy, Borin, and Humbert. Misfortune, however,
dogged the fleet from the very commencement, for the
<name type="ship">Séduisant</name>, a seventy-four-gun battle-ship, got on shore shortly
after leaving Brest, and out of thirteen hundred seamen and
soldiers on board six hundred and eighty were drowned.
</p>

<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>

<p>
They were noticed by Vice-admiral <anchor id="corr341"/><corr sic="Colpoy’s">Colpoys’</corr> fleet, who sent
off two frigates to warn Lord Bridport, and after chasing the
French for some distance himself, sailed for Falmouth to
report the setting out of the expedition.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Bouvet, with thirty-two sail, managed to reach the
mouth of Bantry Bay, but the weather was so tempestuous
that he was unable to land his troops. After struggling for
some days against this boisterous weather, the fleet scattered,
and the majority of the ships returned to Brest. The rest
reached the coast of Ireland, but not finding the main portion
of their fleet there, they returned to France.
</p>

<p>
The failure of the expedition was as complete as was that
of the Spanish Armada, and was due greatly to the same
cause. Out of the forty-four ships that sailed from Brest
only thirty-one managed to return to France. The British
frigates, by the vigilance they displayed, had done good service,
cutting off four transports and three ships of war; but
the stormy weather had dispersed the expedition, and was accountable
for the loss of two battle-ships, three frigates, and a
transport. It was curious that although Lord Bridport’s fleet
was constantly patrolling the Channel during this time, the
two fleets never came in contact.

<head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>

<head type="sub">ST. VINCENT AND CAMPERDOWN</head>

<p>
On the 19th of January, 1797, Lord Bridport detached
Rear-admiral Parker with five battle-ships—among them
the <name type="ship">Jason</name>—and one frigate, to Gibraltar, and on the 6th of
February they joined Admiral Sir John Jervis off Cape St.
Vincent.
</p>

<p>
They were cruising along the Portuguese coast when, on
the morning of the 13th of February, Nelson brought Admiral
Jervis the long-expected news of the approach of the Spanish
fleet. Its exact strength he had not discovered, but it was
known to exceed twenty sail of the line, while Jervis had but
fifteen, two of which had been greatly injured by a collision
the night before. The repairs, however, were quickly executed,
and they fell into their positions. Jervis made the
signal to prepare for action. During the night the signal guns
of the Spaniards were heard, and before daylight a Portuguese
frigate came along and reported that they were about four
leagues to windward. At that time the fleet were south-west
of Cape St. Vincent. The Spaniards, who had hitherto been
prevented by an adverse wind from getting into Cadiz, were
ready to meet us, not knowing that the British admiral had
been reinforced, and believing that he had but some ten ships.
</p>

<p>
The wind, however, changed during the night, and, acting
in strict obedience to his orders, the Spanish commander-in-chief
determined to set sail for Cadiz. When day broke, his
fleet was seen about five miles off, the main body huddled
<pb n='343'/><anchor id='Pg343'/>together in a confused group, with one squadron to leeward.
It was then seen what a formidable fleet lay before us. The
admiral’s flag was carried by the <name type="ship">Santissima-Trinidada</name>, one
hundred and thirty, and he had with him six three-deckers of
one hundred and twelve guns each, two of eighty, and eighteen
seventy-fours. Our fleet had scarcely half the ships and
guns. We had two ships of one hundred guns, three of
ninety-eight, one of ninety, eight seventy-fours, and a sixty-four.
There was, however, no comparison between the men.
Our own were for the most part tried and trained sailors,
while a considerable proportion of the Spaniards were almost
raw levies.
</p>

<p>
The morning of the 14th February was foggy, and neither
the number nor the size of our ships could be made out by the
Spaniards until we were within a mile of them. Then, as mid-day
approached and the fog cleared off, they saw Jervis bearing
down upon them in two lines. His object was to separate
the Spanish squadron to leeward from the main body, and in
this he completely succeeded.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Culloden</name> led the way, and the greater part of the fleet
followed, opening a tremendous fire as they came up with
the Spaniards, and receiving their broadsides in return. The
Spanish vice-admiral attempted to cut through the British line,
but was thwarted by the rapid advance of the <name type="ship">Victory</name>, which
forced the admiral’s ship, the <name type="ship">Principe de Asturias</name>, to tack close
under her lee, pouring in a tremendous raking broadside as
she did so. Fortunately at this moment Commodore Nelson
was in the rear, and had a better view of the movements of
the enemy than had the commander-in-chief. He perceived
that the Spanish admiral was beginning to bear up before the
<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>wind, with the object of uniting the main body with the second
division. Accordingly he ordered his ship the <name type="ship">Captain</name> to
wear.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time she had hardly fired a gun, but this movement
gave her the lead of the fleet, and brought her at once
into action with the enemy. In a few minutes she was attacked
by no fewer than four first-raters and two third-raters.
The <name type="ship">Culloden</name>, however, bore down with all speed to her assistance,
and some time afterwards the <name type="ship">Blenheim</name> came up to take
a share in the fight. Two of the Spanish ships dropped astern
to escape the tremendous fire of the three British seventy-fours,
but they only fell in with the <name type="ship">Excellent</name> coming up to support
the <name type="ship">Captain</name>, and she poured so tremendous a fire into them
both that one of them struck at once. She left the other to
her own devices and pressed on to join Nelson, who greatly
needed help, for the <name type="ship">Captain</name> was now little better than a
wreck.
</p>

<p>
Her chief antagonist at this time was the <name type="ship">San Nicholas</name>.
Into that ship she poured a tremendous fire, and then passed
on to the <name type="ship">San Isidro</name> and <name type="ship">Santissima-Trinidada</name>, with which the
<name type="ship">Captain</name> had been engaged from the beginning. The fire of the
<name type="ship">Excellent</name> had completed the work done by the <name type="ship">Captain</name>, and
the <name type="ship">San Nicholas</name> and the <name type="ship">San Josef</name> had collided with each
other. Nelson, being in so crippled a state that he could no
longer take an active part in the action, laid his ship alongside
the <name type="ship">San Nicholas</name> and carried her by boarding; and after this
was done the crew crossed to the <name type="ship">San Josef</name>, and carried her
also. Other prizes had been taken elsewhere; the <name type="ship">Salvador Del
Mundo</name> and <name type="ship">Santissima-Trinidada</name> surrendered, as did the <name type="ship">Soberano</name>.
The <name type="ship">Santissima-Trinidada</name>, however, was towed away by
<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>one of her frigates. Evening was closing in, and as the
Spanish fleet still greatly outnumbered the British, Jervis
made the signal to discontinue the action, and the next morning
the fleets sailed in different directions, the British carrying
their four prizes with them. Considering the desperate nature
of the fighting the British loss was extraordinarily small, only
seventy-three being killed and two hundred and twenty-seven
wounded. Of these nearly a third belonged to the <name type="ship">Captain</name>,
upon which the brunt of the fight had fallen. For this victory
Admiral Jervis was made an earl, and two admirals baronets.
Nelson might have had a baronetcy, but he preferred the
ribbon of the Bath. Also, he shortly afterwards was promoted
to the rank of Rear-admiral. Captain Calder received the
ribbon of the Bath, and all the first lieutenants were promoted.
</p>

<p>
The captain of the <name type="ship">Jason</name> had earned golden opinions from
his crew by the manner in which he had fought his vessel and
the careless indifference he had shown to the enemy’s fire as
he walked up and down on the quarter-deck issuing what
orders were necessary. Their losses had not been heavy, but
among them, to Will’s deep regret, the first lieutenant had
been killed by a cannon-ball.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am grieved indeed,</q> the captain said the next morning
to Will, <q>at the death of Mr. Somerville. He was an excellent
officer and a most worthy man. It is, however, a consolation
to me that I have a successor so worthy to take his
place. Since we have sailed together, Mr. Gilmore, I have
always been gratified by the manner in which you have done
your duty, and by the skill you have shown in handling the
ship during your watch. It is a great satisfaction to me that
I have so good an officer for my first lieutenant.</q>
</p>

<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>

<p>
It was but a few months after the battle of St. Vincent that
a greater danger threatened England than she had ever before
been exposed to. The seamen in the navy had long been
seething with discontent, and all their petitions had been
neglected, their remonstrances treated as of no account.
</p>

<p>
Rendered desperate, they at last determined to mutiny, and
the first outbreak occurred on the 15th April in the Channel
fleet, which was at the time anchored at Spithead. On
Admiral Lord Bridport giving the signal to weigh anchor, the
seamen of the flagship, instead of proceeding to their stations,
ran up the rigging and gave three cheers, and the crews of
the rest of the ships at once did the same. The officers
attempted to induce the men to return to their duty, but in
vain. The next day two delegates from each ship met on the
<name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name>, the flagship, to deliberate, and the day after
all the men swore to stand by their leaders, and such officers
as had rendered themselves obnoxious to the men were put
on shore.
</p>

<p>
The delegates then drew up two petitions, one to Parliament
the other to the Admiralty, asking that their wages
should be increased—they had remained at the same point
since Charles II was king,—that the pound should be reckoned
at sixteen ounces instead of fourteen, and that the food should
be of better quality. Further, that vegetables should be
occasionally served out, that the sick should be better attended
and their medical comforts not embezzled; and, finally, that
on returning from sea the men should be allowed a short
leave to visit their friends.
</p>

<p>
On the 18th a committee of the Board of Admiralty arrived
at Portsmouth, and in answer to the petition agreed to ask
<pb n='347'/><anchor id='Pg347'/>the king to propose to Parliament an increase of wages, and
also to grant them certain other privileges; but these terms
the sailors would not accept, and expressed their determination
not to weigh anchor till their full demands were granted.
</p>

<p>
The committee now sent, through Lord Bridport, a letter
to the seamen granting still further concessions, and promising
pardon to all concerned; but the sailors answered expressing
their thanks for what had been granted, but reiterating their
demands.
</p>

<p>
On the 21st Vice-admirals Sir Allen Gardner and Colpoys
and Rear-admiral Pole went on board the <name type="ship">Queen Charlotte</name> to
confer, but they were informed that until the reforms were
sanctioned by the king and Parliament they would not be
accepted as final. This so angered Admiral Gardner that he
seized one of the delegates by the collar and swore he would
hang the lot, and every fifth man in the fleet. The delegates
at once returned to their ships, and the seamen of the fleet
proceeded to load the guns. Watches were set as at sea, and
the ships were put into a complete state of defence.
</p>

<p>
On the 22nd Lord Bridport, having received a letter from
the mutineers explaining the cause of the steps they had
taken, went on board, and after a short deliberation his offers
were accepted, and the men returned to their duty.
</p>

<p>
The fleet was detained at St. Helens by a foul wind until
the 7th of May, when news was received that the French were
preparing to sail. Lord Bridport made the signal to weigh,
but the crews again refused to obey orders, alleging that the
silence that Parliament had observed respecting their grievances
led them to suspect that the promised redress was to be
withheld.
</p>

<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>

<p>
For four days matters continued in the same state, but on
the 14th Admiral Lord Howe arrived from London with full
powers to settle all disputes with an Act of Parliament which
had been passed on the 9th, and a proclamation granting the
king’s pardon to all who should return at once to their duty.
</p>

<p>
After various discussions the men agreed to the terms, and
on the 16th May, all matters having been amicably settled,
Lord Bridport put to sea with his fleet of fifteen sail of the
line.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding these concessions the sailors of the ships
lying at the Nore broke into mutiny on the 20th of May,
their ringleader being a seaman of the name of Richard
Parker, one of a class of men denominated sea-lawyers. The
delegates drew up a statement of demands containing eight
articles, most of which were perfectly impossible, and the
Admiralty replied by pointing out the concessions the Legislature
had recently made, and refusing to accede to any more,
but offering to pardon the men if they would at once return
to their duty. The mutineers refused, and hoisted the red
flag. They landed at Sheerness and marched through the
streets, and in many ways went to greater lengths than their
comrades at Spithead. They even flogged and otherwise ill-treated
some of the officers.
</p>

<p>
This outbreak now assumed the most alarming proportions.
Eleven ships belonging to the North Sea fleet, on the way to
blockade the Texel, turned back and joined Parker, and the
greatest alarm was felt in London, the Funds falling to an
unheard-of price. The Government acted, however, with
vigour; buoys were removed, and the forts were manned and
the men ordered to open fire should the fleet sail up the river.
<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>Bills were rushed through Parliament in two days, authorizing
the utmost penalties on the mutineers and on all who aided
them.
</p>

<p>
This had the desired effect, and early in June the fleets at
Portsmouth and Plymouth disavowed all complicity with
Parker, and two ships—the <name type="ship">Leopard</name> and <name type="ship">Repulse</name>—hauled down
the red flag and retreated up the Thames, being fired on by
the rest of the fleet. The example was, however, contagious,
and ship after ship deserted until, on the 14th, the crew of the
<name type="ship">Sandwich</name> handed over Parker to the authorities.
</p>

<p>
He was tried, convicted, and hanged on board that ship
on the 29th of June. Some of the other leaders were also
hanged, some were flogged through the fleet, and some sent
to prison.
</p>

<p>
The mutiny was not confined to the ships on the home
stations, but it never became serious at any point, and a
display of timely severity soon brought matters back to their
usual condition of discipline and obedience to orders.
</p>

<p>
A mutiny of a different character, as it was caused by the
tyranny of the captain, and had very different results, took
place in the West Indies.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 21st of September the thirty-two-gun
frigate <name type="ship">Hermione</name> was cruising off Porto Rico. Its captain,
Pigot, was known to be one of the most harsh and brutal
officers in the navy. On the previous day, while the crew
were reefing topsails, he had called out that he would flog the
last man down. The poor fellows, knowing well that he would
keep his word, hurried down; and two of them, in trying to
jump over those below them, missed their footing and were
killed. When this was reported to the captain he simply said:
<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/><q>Throw the lubbers overboard.</q> All the other men were
severely reprimanded. The result of this, the last of a succession
of similar acts of tyranny, was that the crew broke
into mutiny. The first lieutenant went to enquire into the
disturbance, but he was killed and thrown overboard. The
captain, hearing the tumult, ran on deck, but he suffered the
same fate as his second in command. The mutineers then
proceeded to murder eight other officers, two lieutenants, the
purser, the surgeon, the captain’s clerk, one midshipman, the
boatswain, and the lieutenant of marines. The master, a midshipman,
and the gunner were the only officers spared. They
then carried the ship into the port of La Guayra, representing
to the Spanish governor that they had turned their officers
adrift. The real circumstances of the case were explained
to the governor by the British admiral, but he insisted upon
detaining the vessel and fitting her out as a Spanish frigate.
</p>

<p>
Many of the perpetrators of this horrible crime were afterwards
captured and executed. Had they contented themselves
with wreaking their vengeance on their captain, some excuse
might have been offered for them when the catalogue of his
brutalities was published, but nothing could be said in condonation
of the cold-blooded murder of the other officers,
including even a midshipman and the young captain’s clerk,
neither of whom could have in any way influenced their
commander’s conduct.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Hermione</name>, however, was of but little use to the
Spaniards. Sir Hyde Parker, in October, 1799, hearing that
she was about to sail from Porto Cabello, in Havana, detached
the <name type="ship">Surprise</name> under Captain Hamilton, to attempt to obtain
possession of her. On arriving off Porto Cabello he found the
<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/><name type="ship">Hermione</name>, which was manned by four hundred men, moored
between two strong batteries at the entrance to the harbour,
but, nothing daunted, Captain Hamilton resolved to cut her
out. At eight o’clock in the evening he pushed off from the
<name type="ship">Surprise</name> with all his boats, manned by one hundred officers and
men.
</p>

<p>
Undeterred by a heavy fire, the boats made for the <name type="ship">Hermione</name>
and were soon alongside. The main attack at the gangways
was beaten off, but the captain, with his cutter’s crew,
made good his footing on the forecastle, and here he was
joined by the crew of the gig and some of the men from the
jolly-boat. He then fought his way to the quarter-deck,
where he was soon reinforced by the crews of the boats that
had at first been repulsed. In a very short time, after some
desperate fighting, the <name type="ship">Hermione</name> was captured. The cables
were now cut and the sails hoisted, and under a heavy fire
from the batteries the frigate was brought off, though much
damaged both in rigging and hull. A few days later she
anchored in Port Royal.
</p>

<p>
This feat stands perhaps unparalleled in naval history for its
audacity and success. The victors had only twelve wounded;
the enemy lost one hundred and nineteen killed and ninety-seven
wounded. Captain Hamilton was knighted for this
achievement, the legislature of Jamaica presented him with a
sword valued at three hundred guineas, and on his arrival in
England after his exchange, for he was taken prisoner on his
way home, the common council of London voted him the
freedom of the city. He was, however, much injured in the
attack, and was to the end of his life under medical treatment.
</p>

<p>
After the battle of St. Vincent the <name type="ship">Jason</name> required some
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>repairs to her hull, but as her spars were uninjured she was
ordered by Admiral Jervis to proceed to Portsmouth with
despatches. Here, to Will’s great joy, he was confirmed in
his position as first lieutenant. He was unable to get leave,
as it was found the repairs would take but a short time, and
after ten days’ stay in port the <name type="ship">Jason</name> sailed to join Lord
Bridport’s fleet. On doing so, she was at once despatched to
reinforce the North Sea fleet under Admiral Duncan, then
blockading the Texel.
</p>

<p>
It was while engaged in this monotonous work that the news
came of Admiral Nelson’s disastrous attack on Santa Cruz.
The expedition was a complete failure, one hundred and
forty-one being killed or drowned, and one hundred and five
wounded or missing. Among the wounded was Admiral
Nelson himself, who lost his arm.
</p>

<p>
The news of the mutinies taking place at Spithead and the
Nore was a source of great anxiety to the officers, but the men
were so attached to them that there was no real cause for
uneasiness with regard to their own ship, and when the eleven
ships of Duncan’s fleet joined the mutineers at the Nore, the
<name type="ship">Jason</name> was one of the few that remained with the admiral.
</p>

<p>
During the equinoctial gales many of the ships were so
badly strained that Admiral Duncan returned to Yarmouth
Roads to gather and repair his fleet, leaving the <name type="ship">Jason</name> and
two other ships to watch the enemy. De Winter lost not a
moment in taking advantage of his absence, and on the 7th
of October sailed out with his whole fleet, chasing the watch
vessels before him. On their way, however, they met a
squadron under Captain Trollope, consisting of Duncan’s ships
which had been refitted. The Dutch fleet, on seeing them,
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>thought that the whole British fleet was behind, and not
at the time wishing to engage, went about and steered again
for the Texel. On the 9th the <name type="ship">Active</name> came in sight off
Yarmouth Roads with the signal flying that the enemy were
at sea. At once a general chase was ordered, and by the time
the <name type="ship">Active</name> joined them the whole fleet was under way. Her
captain was hailed and ordered to guide the fleet to the
precise spot where he had last seen the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Captain Trollope had, as soon as the Dutch fleet went
about, started in chase of them, and kept them in sight
until they approached the Texel, when he steered to meet
Admiral Duncan. He was therefore able to give the exact
position of the enemy, and at once the fleet sailed towards
them. On the morning of the 11th October, 1797, the admiral
came in sight of the enemy about nine miles from shore and
nearly opposite the village of Camperdown. The fleet, however,
was greatly scattered owing to the different speeds of
the ships. De Winter, as soon as he saw the British coming,
got up his anchors and made for shore, hoping that he might
be able to get so close in among its shoals and sand-banks,
which were much better known to him than to his antagonists,
as to deter Duncan from pursuing him. He was, above all
things, anxious to avoid action; not so much because his
fleet was slightly inferior to the British, as because his instructions
enjoined him to regard his junction with the French
at Brest as his chief object.
</p>

<p>
The British admiral, seeing his arrangements and divining
his object, pressed on, regardless of the scattered state of his
fleet, and made the signal for each ship to attack as she came
up. Another signal intimated that he should attempt to
<pb n='354'/><anchor id='Pg354'/>break the enemy’s line, so as to get between it and the land.
But this signal was not generally seen by the fleet. It was,
however, seen and acted upon by the second in command,
Admiral Onslow, in the <name type="ship">Monarch</name>, who soon after led the
larboard division through the Dutch line, three ships from
the rear, and then closely engaged the <name type="ship">Jupiter</name>. Duncan’s own
ship, the <name type="ship">Venerable</name>, the leading ship of the starboard division,
marked out the <name type="ship">Vryhide</name>, De Winter’s flagship, as his own
antagonist.
</p>

<p>
The Dutch ship <name type="ship">States-general</name>, the flagship of their rear-admiral,
seeing his design, pressed so close up to his chief
that the British admiral was compelled to change his course
and pass astern of her; but as he did so he poured so terrible
a fire into her stern that she was glad to fall back and leave
the <name type="ship">Venerable</name> free to attack the <name type="ship">Vryhide</name>. Others of our ships
followed the example of their chief, breaking the Dutch line
at several points. At one o’clock the battle became general,
and was carried on with unsurpassed courage on both sides.
The two biggest Dutch frigates, which carried as heavy guns
as the British line-of-battle ships, crept forward into the fight
and fought gallantly, the <name type="ship">Mars</name> raking the <name type="ship">Venerable</name> severely
while she was engaged with no fewer than three Dutch line-of-battle
ships.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the <name type="ship">Venerable</name> had been particularly anxious to
fight, their ship having been for the past five months engaged
in the dreary work of blockading the Texel; and when they
had seen the Dutch with their topsails bent, as if intending
to come out, they had offered to advance into the narrow
entrance to the Texel, and in that position stop the way
against the whole fleet, or at least fight their ship till she
<pb n='355'/><anchor id='Pg355'/>sank. Now they proved that their offer had been no empty
boast, for, although fighting against overwhelming odds, they
stuck to their guns with unexampled devotion.
</p>

<p>
More than once every flag they hoisted was shot away, and
at last one of the sailors went aloft and nailed the admiral’s
colours to the stump of the main topgallant mast. The <name type="ship">Vryhide</name>
also fought with desperate courage. Other British ships, however,
came up, and the disparity in numbers turned the other
way. The <name type="ship">Ardent</name> attacked her on the other side, and the
<name type="ship">Triumph</name> and <name type="ship">Director</name> poured a raking fire along her decks.
One after another her masts fell, and the wreck rendered half
her guns unworkable. Her crew were swept away, until De
Winter was left alone on her quarter-deck, while below there
were hardly enough men left to man the pumps. Then the
gallant admiral with his own hand hauled down his colours,
having fought to the admiration of the whole British fleet.
The <name type="ship">States-general</name>, almost disabled by the fruitless attempt to
foul the <name type="ship">Venerable</name>, maintained a vigorous conflict for some
time against a succession of adversaries, during which she lost
above three hundred men killed and wounded, until at last her
captain was compelled to strike. No one, however, attempted
to take possession of her, and, gradually dropping astern until
clear of both fleets, she rehoisted her colours and made off to
the Texel.

  </else></pgIf>
<p>
Ship after ship struck, and of the whole Dutch fleet but six
ships of the line and two frigates managed to reach the Texel,
and this was only due to the fact that several of the Dutch
vessels, knowing that the orders had been that they were not
to fight, stood aloof and disregarded their admiral’s signal to
engage. The entire casualties among our men exceeded a
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>thousand. Many of the ships were completely riddled by
shot, and on some of them the men were employed day and
night at the pumps to keep them afloat till they could cross
the Channel to our own harbours. Two seventy-fours, five
fifty-fours, two gun-ships, and two frigates remained in our
hands, but all were so battered that not one of them could
ever be made fit for service. The two fleets were nearly
equal in strength, the British being about one-twelfth the
stronger. Some of the Dutch ships took no share in the
action, but the same is true of the British. Some of them
arrived too late, the hazy weather having prevented the
signals of the <name type="ship">Venerable</name> from being seen by them. For one
of them, however, the <name type="ship">Agincourt</name>, no excuse could be found, so
her captain was tried by court-martial and declared incapable
of serving in the navy for the future.
</p>

<p>
The <name type="ship">Jason</name> had taken her share in the battle. She had at
once placed herself alongside the <name type="ship">Brutus</name>, a battle-ship of the
same size as herself. All the afternoon the duel was continued,
and both ships lost some masts and spars and had their hulls
completely shattered. It was not until the engagement had
almost ceased elsewhere that the enemy hauled down her
colours. The battle was a desperate one, and Will had felt
the strain greatly; there was comparatively little for him to
do, for both ships sailed along side by side, and there was no
attempt at manœuvring. He had, therefore, simply to move
about, encouraging the sailors and directing their fire. So
incessant was the cannonade that it was with difficulty he could
make his orders heard, and, cool as he was, he was almost
confused by the terrible din that went on around. It was
found, after the <name type="ship">Brutus</name> surrendered, that her loss had been
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>one hundred and twenty killed and wounded, while on board
the <name type="ship">Jason</name> little over half that number had suffered.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the prize surrendered, parties were put on board
to take possession, while the rest of the men were engaged in
attending to their own and the Dutch wounded. The next
day jury-masts were got up, and the <name type="ship">Jason</name>, with her prize in
tow, sailed with the rest of the fleet for England. When they
arrived at Sheerness the <name type="ship">Jason</name> was found to require a complete
refit. The crew were therefore ordered to be paid off, and
Will was promoted to the rank of captain, and at once
appointed to the command of the frigate <name type="ship">Ethalion</name>, thirty-four
guns, which had just been fitted ready for sea.
</p>

<p>
He had no difficulty in manning his ship, as a sufficient
number of the <name type="ship">Jason’s</name> old crew volunteered, and he was soon
ready for service.
</p>

<p>
He was at once despatched to join Lord Bridport’s fleet,
and for nearly nine months was engaged in the incessant
patrolling which at that time the British frigates maintained
in the Channel.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of July, 1798, the vigilance of the frigates,
if possible, increased, for it became known that two French
squadrons were being prepared with the intention of landing
troops in Ireland. On the 6th of August a small squadron
slipped out of Rochefort, and, eluding the British cruisers,
succeeded, on the 22nd, in landing General Humbert and
eleven hundred and fifty men at Killala Bay, and then at
once returned to Rochefort.
</p>

<p>
The attempt ended in failure; the peasantry did not join as
was expected, and on the 8th of September General Humbert
surrendered at Ballinamuck to Lieutenant-general Lake.
</p>

<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>

<p>
Another fleet sailed from Brest on the 16th of September,
1798, consisting of one ship of the line, the <name type="ship">Hoche</name>, and eight
frigates, under Commodore Bompart. It had on board three
thousand troops, a large train of artillery, and a great quantity
of military stores. It had set sail for Ireland before the news
of the failure of Humbert’s expedition had arrived, and it
was certain that as soon as it reached its intended place of
landing in Ireland it would endeavour to return without delay.
Two or three days earlier the <name type="ship">Ethalion</name> and the eighteen-gun
brig <name type="ship">Sylph</name> had joined the thirty-eight-gun frigate <name type="ship">Boadicea</name>,
which was watching Brest. At daybreak a light breeze
sprang up, and the French made sail. Leaving the <name type="ship">Ethalion</name>
to watch the French fleet, the <name type="ship">Boadicea</name> sailed to carry the
news of the start of the expedition to Lord Bridport.
</p>

<p>
At two o’clock on the 18th the <name type="ship">Ethalion</name> was joined by the
<name type="ship">Amelia</name>, a thirty-eight-gun frigate, and at daylight the French
directed their course as if for the West Indies. At eight
o’clock they bore up, and five of their frigates chased the
English ships. Presently, however, finding that they did not
gain, they rejoined the squadron, which bore away to the
south-west. On the 20th the two frigates were joined by the
forty-four-gun frigate <name type="ship">Anson</name>. At noon the French were nearly
becalmed. There was now no doubt that the destination of
the squadron was Ireland, and the news was despatched by
the <name type="ship">Sylph</name> to the commander-in-chief of the Irish station.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th the French ships turned on the frigates, but
gave this up about noon, and proceeded on their way. The
sea now became so rough that all the ships shortened sail.
On the 29th the weather moderated, and the French squadron
again started in chase. About nine o’clock the French
battle-<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>ship, the <name type="ship">Hoche</name>, sprung her main-topmast, and one of the
French frigates carried away her top-sail yard. At this both
the French and the British ships shortened sail. The French
ships wore away to the north-west, and the British again
followed them; but the <name type="ship">Anson</name> had sprung her topmast, and in
the evening the <name type="ship">Hoche</name> lowered hers. The weather now became
very bad, and the frigates hauled up and soon lost sight of the
enemy. A week later the <name type="ship">Amelia</name> left them, but three days
after, they fell in with the squadron that had been despatched
from Cawsand Bay when the <name type="ship">Boadicea</name> arrived with news of
the start of the French squadron from Brest. They were also
joined by the frigates <name type="ship">Melampus</name> and <name type="ship">Doris</name>, which while at
Lough Swilly had received news from the <name type="ship">Sylph</name> of the destination
of the French squadron. The whole were under the
command of Sir John Warren.
</p>

<p>
With the hope that he had now shaken off his pursuers,
Admiral Bompart bore away for Killala Bay, but as he neared
the land his leading frigate signalled the appearance of the
British squadron. Sir John Warren immediately gave the
signal for a general chase, but a heavy gale set in that evening,
during which the <name type="ship">Anson</name> carried away her mizzen-mast main-yard
and main-topsail-yard. The <name type="ship">Hoche</name>, however, was even
more unfortunate, for she carried away her main-topmast, and
this in its fall brought down the fore and mizzen-topgallant-masts.
A few hours later the <name type="ship">Résolue</name> signalled that she had
sprung a leak which she could not stop, and the admiral
signalled orders to her captain to sail towards the coast, and
by burning blue lights and sending up rockets to endeavour
to lead the British squadron after him, and so allow the rest
of the fleet to make off.
</p>

<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>

<p>
Admiral Bompart now changed his course, but at daybreak
found himself almost surrounded by the British vessels. Both
squadrons waited, but with very different feelings, the order
to commence action. The <name type="ship">Robust</name> led the way, followed closely
by the <name type="ship">Magnanime</name>, and was received with a fire from the stern-chasers
and the quarter guns of the French frigates <name type="ship">Embuscade</name>
and <name type="ship">Coquille</name>. A few minutes later the <name type="ship">Robust</name> returned the
fire, and bore down to leeward for the purpose of engaging
the <name type="ship">Hoche</name>, which, like herself, was a seventy-four-gun ship.
In half an hour all the French frigates that could get away
were making off. The <name type="ship">Hoche</name> by this time was a mere wreck,
having suffered terribly from the fire of the <name type="ship">Robust</name>; her hull
was riddled with shot, she had five feet of water in her hold,
twenty-five of her guns were dismounted, and a great portion
of her crew were killed and wounded. After the battle had
raged for three hours she struck her colours. The <name type="ship">Embuscade</name>
had also surrendered. The other British vessels set out in
pursuit of the fugitives. The <name type="ship">Coquille</name>, after a brave resistance,
was forced to haul down her colours, and the <name type="ship">Ethalion</name> pursued
and captured the <name type="ship">Bellone</name>. Five French frigates attempted to
escape, and in doing so sailed close to the <name type="ship">Anson</name>, which had
been unable to take part in the action owing to the loss of her
mizzen-mast, and as they passed ahead of her, poured in such
destructive broadsides that she lost her fore and main masts,
and had much other serious damage. Of the ships that had
escaped, the <name type="ship">Résolue</name> was captured two or three days later.
The <name type="ship">Loire</name> made a good fight; she was pursued by the <name type="ship">Mermaid</name>,
and <name type="ship">Kangaroo</name>. The latter, which was an eighteen-gun
brig, engaged her, but lost her fore-topmast. The <name type="ship">Mermaid</name>,
a thirty-two-gun frigate, continued the pursuit.
</p>

<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>

<p>
At daybreak the <name type="ship">Loire</name>, seeing that her pursuer was alone,
shortened sail. As the <name type="ship">Loire</name> was a forty-gun ship the fight
was a desperate one, and both vessels were so badly injured
that by mutual consent they ceased fire. The <name type="ship">Mermaid</name> lost
her mizzen-mast, main topmast, and had her shrouds, spars,
and boats cut to pieces. She was also making a great deal of
water, and was therefore necessarily obliged to discontinue the
fight. The <name type="ship">Loire</name>, however, was out of luck, for a day or two
later she fell in with the <name type="ship">Anson</name> and <name type="ship">Kangaroo</name>, and in consequence
of her battered condition she had to surrender without
resistance. Similarly, the <name type="ship">Immortalité</name>, while making her way
to Brest, fell in with the <name type="ship">Fisgard</name>, a vessel of just the same
size. The <name type="ship">Immortalité’s</name> fire was so well aimed that in a short
time the <name type="ship">Fisgard</name> was quite unmanageable. Repairs, however,
were executed with great promptness, and after a chase the
action was recommenced. At the end of half an hour the
<name type="ship">Fisgard</name> had received several shots between wind and water
and she had six feet of water in her hold. Nevertheless
she continued the fight, and at three o’clock the <name type="ship">Immortalité</name>,
which was in a semi-sinking state, and had lost her captain
and first lieutenant, hauled down her colours.
</p>

<p>
Thus seven out of the ten vessels under the command of
Commodore Bompart were captured.
</p>

<p>
In the combat with the <name type="ship">Bellone</name> Will had been slightly
wounded, and as he was most anxious to proceed with his
investigation with regard to his relations, he applied for leave
on his arrival at Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
This was at once granted, and at the same time he received
his promotion to post rank in consequence of his capture of
the <name type="ship">Bellone</name>.

<head>CHAPTER XIX</head>

<head type="sub">CONCLUSION</head>

<p>
Will’s first visit, after arriving in London, was to Dulwich.
He had visited the house with Mr. Palethorpe
when it was in progress of building, and had been favourably
impressed with it, but now that it was complete he thought
it was one of the prettiest houses that he had ever seen. The
great conservatory was full of plants and shrubs, which he
recognized as natives of Jamaica, and the garden was brilliant
with bright flowers.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am delighted to see you again, Will,</q> Mr. Palethorpe
said, as he was shown in. <q>Alice is out at present, but she
will be back before long. I must congratulate you on your
promotion, which I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> this morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, my good fortune sticks to me, except for this
wound, and it is nothing serious and will soon be right again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don’t say good fortune, lad. You have won your way by
conduct and courage, and you have a right to be proud of
your position. I believe you are the youngest captain in the
service, and that without a shadow of private interest to push
you on. I am very glad to hear that your wound is so slight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not looking well, sir,</q> Will said, after they had
chatted for a time.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I have had a shock which, I am ashamed to say,
I have allowed to annoy me. I came home with £70,000.
Of that I invested £40,000 in good securities, and allowed the
rest to remain in my agent’s hands until he came upon some
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>good and safe security. Well, I was away with Alice in the
country when he wrote to me to say that he strongly recommended
me to buy a South Sea stock which everyone was
running after, and which was rising rapidly. I must own that
it seemed a good thing, so I told him to buy. Well, it went
up like wildfire, and I could have sold out at four times the
price at which I bought. At last I wrote to him to realize,
and he replied that it had suddenly fallen a bit, and recommending
me to wait till it went up again, which it was sure to
do. I didn’t see a London paper for some days, and when I
did get one I found, to my horror, that the bubble had burst,
and that the stock was virtually not worth the paper on which
it was printed. The blow has affected me a good deal. I
admit now that it was foolish, and feel it so; but when a man
has been working all his life, it is hard to see nearly half of
the fortune he has gained swept away at a blow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is hard, sir, very hard. Still, it was fortunate that you
had already invested £40,000 in good securities. After all,
with this house and £40,000 you will really not so very much
miss the sum you have lost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is exactly what I tell myself, Will. Still, you know,
a dog with two bones in his mouth will growl if he loses one
of them. Nevertheless £40,000 is not to be despised by any
means, and I shall have plenty to give my little Alice a good
portion when she marries.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That will be comfortable for her, sir, but I should say that
the man would be lucky if he got her without a shilling.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well, we’ll see, we’ll see. I have no desire to part
with her yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I can well understand, sir.</q>
</p>

<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>

<p>
<q>Ah, here she is!</q>
</p>

<p>
A rosy colour spread over the girl’s face when she saw who
her father’s visitor was.
</p>

<p>
<q>I expected you in a day or two,</q> she said, <q>but not so
soon as this. When we saw your name in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> we made
sure that it would not be long before you paid us a visit. I
am glad to see that your wound has not pulled you down
much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No indeed. I am all right; but it was certain that I
should come here first of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what are your plans now?</q> Mr. Palethorpe asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going to set to work at once to discover my family.
I have not been to my lawyer yet, so I don’t know how much
he has done, but I certainly mean to go into the business in
earnest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it doesn’t matter to you much now, Will, whether
your family are dukes or beggars. You can stand on your
own feet as a captain in the royal navy with a magnificent
record of services.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I see that, sir; but still I certainly do wish to be
able to prove that I come of at least a respectable family. I
have not the least desire to obtain any rank or anything of that
kind, only to know that I have people of my own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not say that it is not a laudable ambition, but I don’t
believe that anyone would think one scrap better or worse of
you were you to find that you were heir to a dukedom.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will slept there that night, and the next morning drove
into the city to his lawyer’s office. <q>Well, Captain Gilmore?</q>
said that gentleman as Will entered his private room. <q rend="post: none">I
am glad to see you. I have been quietly at work making
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>enquiries since you were last here. I sent a man down to
Scarcombe some months ago. He learned as much as he could
there, and since then has been going from village to village
and has traced your father’s journeyings for some months.
Now that you are home I should suggest employing two or
three men to continue the search and to find out if possible
the point from which your father started his wanderings.
Assuming, as I do, that he was the son of Sir Ralph Gilmore,
I imagine that he must have quarrelled with his father at
or about the time of his marriage. In that case he would
probably come up to London. I have observed that most
men who quarrel with their parents take that step first.
There, perhaps, he endeavoured to obtain employment. The
struggle would probably last two, or three, or four years. I
take the last to be the most likely period, for by that time
you would be about three years old. I say that because he
could hardly have taken you with him had you been younger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is evident that he had either no hope of being reconciled
to his father or that he was himself too angry to make
advances. I therefore propose to send men north from London
to enquire upon all the principal roads. A man with a
violin and a little child cannot have been altogether forgotten
in the villages in which he stopped, and I hope to be able to
trace his way up to Yorkshire. Again, I should employ
one of the Bow Street runners to make enquiries in London
for a man with his wife and child who lived here so many
years ago, and whose name was Gilmore. I am supposing,
you see, that that was his real name, and not one that he had
assumed. I confess I have my doubts about it. A man who
quits his home for ever after a desperate quarrel is as likely
<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>as not to change his name. That of course we must risk.
While these enquiries are being made I should like you to go
back to your old home; it is possible that other mementoes
of his stay there may have escaped the memory of the old
people with whom you lived. Anything of that kind would
be of inestimable value.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go down,</q> Will said. <q>I am afraid there is little
chance of my finding them both alive now. I fancy they were
about fifty-five when I went to live with them, which would
make them near eighty now. One or other of them, however,
may be alive. I have not been to my agent yet, and therefore
do not know whether he still sends them the allowance
I made them.</q>
</p>

<p>
After leaving the lawyer he went to his agent and found
that the allowance was still paid, and regularly acknowledged
by a receipt from the clergyman. He supposed, therefore,
that certainly one, if not both, of the old people were still
alive. He went back to Dulwich and said that he had taken
a seat on the north coach for that day week. <q>I could not
bring myself to leave before,</q> he said, <q>and I knew you would
keep me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, my boy. I don’t think either Alice or myself
would forgive you were you to run away the moment you
returned.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the time came Will started for the north, though he
felt much reluctance to leave Alice. He acknowledged now
to himself that he was deeply in love with her. Though from
her father’s manner he felt that when he asked for her hand
he would not be refused, about Alice herself he felt far less
confident. She was so perfectly open and natural with him
<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>that he feared lest she might regard him rather as a brother
than as a lover, and yet the blush which he had noticed when
he first met her on his return gave him considerable hope.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at Scarborough he stopped for the night at the
house of his old friend Mrs. Archer. She and her husband
listened with surprise and pleasure to his stories of his adventures
in spite of his assurances that these were very ordinary
matters, and that it was chiefly by luck that he had got on.
He was a little surprised when, in reply to this, Mrs. Archer
used the very words Mr. Palethorpe had uttered. <q>It is of
no use your talking in that way, Will,</q> she said. <q>No doubt
you have had very good fortune, but your rapid promotion
can only be due to your conduct and courage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may have conducted myself well,</q> he said warmly, <q>but
not one bit better than other officers in the service. I really
owe my success to the fortunate suggestion of mine as to the
best method of attacking that pirate hold. As a reward for
this the admiral gave me the command of <name type="ship">L’Agile</name>, and so,
piece by piece, it has grown. But it was to my good fortune
in making that suggestion, which really was not made in
earnest, but only in reply to the challenge of another midshipman,
that it has all come about. Above all, Mrs. Archer,
I shall never forget that it was the kindness you showed me,
and the pains you took in my education, that gave me my
start in life.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next day he drove over to Scarcombe, and to his pleasure,
on entering the cottage, found John and his wife both
sitting just where he had last seen them. They both rose
to greet him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God, Will,</q> John said, <q>that we have been spared
<pb n='368'/><anchor id='Pg368'/>to see you alive again! I was afraid that our call might come
before you returned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, father, I don’t think you look a year older than you
did when I last saw you. Both you and mother look good
for another ten years yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If we do, Will, it will be thanks to the good food you
have provided for us. We live like lords; meat every day
for dinner, and fish for breakfast and supper. I should not
feel right if I didn’t have a snack of fish every day. Then
we have ale for dinner and supper. There is no one in the
village who lives as we do. When we first began we both
felt downright fat. Then we agreed that if we went on like
that we never could live till you came back, so we did with
a little less, and as you see we both fill out our clothes a long
way better than we did when you were here last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well you certainly do both look uncommonly well, father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you ain’t married yet, Will?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I’ve not done anything about that yet, though perhaps
it won’t be very long before I find a wife. I am not
going to apply to go on service again for a time, so I’ll
have a chance to look round, though I really have one in
my mind’s eye.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell us all about it, Will,</q> the old woman said eagerly;
<q>you know how interested we must be in anything that
affects you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, mother, among the many adventures I have been
through I must tell you the one connected with this young lady.</q>
</p>

<p>
He then told her of his first meeting, of his stay at her
father’s house, and of the hurricane which they experienced
together.
</p>

<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>

<p>
<q>Well, mother, I met her again unexpectedly more than
two and a half years ago in London. Her father had come
over here to live, and has a fine house at Dulwich. I have
just been staying there for a week, and I have some hope that
when I ask her she will consent to be my wife.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course she will,</q> the old woman said quite indignantly.
<q>How could she do otherwise? Why, if you were to ask the
king’s daughter I am sure she would take you. Here you are,
one of the king’s captains, have done all sorts of wonderful
things, and have beaten his enemies all over the world, and
you are as straight and good-looking a young gentleman as
anyone wants to see. No one, who was not out of her mind,
could think of saying <q>No</q> to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, mother, you are prejudiced! To you I am a sort
of swan that has come out of a duck’s egg.</q>
</p>

<p>
They chatted for some time, and then Will said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you quite sure, John, that the bundle the clergyman
handed over to me contained every single thing my father
left behind him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now I think of it, Will, there is something else.
I never remembered it at the time, but when my old woman
was sweeping a cobweb off the rafters the other day she said:
<q>Why, here is Will’s father’s fiddle</q>, and, sure enough, there
it was. It had been up there from the day you came into the
house, and if we noticed it none of us ever gave it a thought.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember it now,</q> Will exclaimed. <q>When I was a
young boy I used to think I should like to learn to play on it,
and I spoke to Miss Warden about it. But she said I had
better stick to my lessons, and then as I grew up I could
learn it if I still had a fancy to do so.</q>
</p>

<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>

<p>
He got on to a chair, and took it from the rafter on which
it had so long lain. Then he carefully wiped the dust off it.
</p>

<p>
<q>It looks a very old thing, but that makes no difference in
its value to me. I don’t see in the least how this can be any
clue whatever to my father’s identity. Still, I will take it
away with me and show it to my lawyer, who is endeavouring
to trace for me who my father was.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you think that he will succeed, Will?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I rather believe he will. At any rate he has found a gentleman,
a baronet, who has the same name and bears the same
coat of arms as is on the seal which was in my father’s bundle.
We are trying now to trace how my father came down here,
and where he lived before he started. You see I must get
as clear a story as I can before I go to see this gentleman.
Mind, I don’t want anything from him. He may be as rich
as a lord for anything I care, and may refuse to have anything
to do with me, but I want to find out to what family I really
belong.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be a bad lot,</q> John said, <q>to allow your father
to tramp about the country with a fiddle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would not say that,</q> Will said; <q>there are always two
sides to a story, and we know nothing of my father’s reasons
for leaving home. It may have been his fault more than his
father’s, so until I know the rights and wrongs of the case
I will form no judgment whatever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is right, my boy,</q> the old woman said. <q>I have
noticed that when a boy runs away from home and goes
to sea it is as often his fault as his father’s. Sometimes it
is six of one and half a dozen of the other; sometimes the
father is a brute, but more often the son is a scamp, a
worth<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>less fellow, who will settle down to nothing, and brings discredit
on his family. So you are quite right, Will, not to
form any hard judgment on your grandfather till you know
how it all came about.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I certainly don’t mean to, mother. Of course I have so
little recollection of my father that it would not worry me
much if I found that it were his fault, though of course I
would rather know that he was not to blame. Still, I should
wish to like my grandfather if I could, and if I heard that my
poor father was really entirely to blame I should not grieve
much over it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can’t help thinking that he was to blame, Will. He
was a curious-looking man, with a very bitter expression at
times on his face, as if he didn’t care for anyone in the
world, except perhaps yourself, and he often left you alone
in the village when he went and wandered about by himself
on the moor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well,</q> Will said, <q>it matters very little to me which
way it is. It is a very old story now, and I dare say that
there were faults on both sides.</q>
</p>

<p>
Will spent a long day with the old people and then returned
to Scarborough, taking the violin with him. When he told
how he had found it Mr. Archer took the instrument and
examined it carefully.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think really,</q> he said at last, <q>that this violin may
prove a valuable clue, as valuable almost as that coat of arms.
That might very well have been picked up or bought for
a trifle at a pawnshop, or come into the hands of its possessor
in some accidental way. But this is different; this,
unless I am greatly mistaken, is a real Amati, and therefore
<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>worth at least a couple of hundred guineas. That could
hardly have come accidentally into the hands of a wandering
musician; it must be a relic of a time when he was in very
different circumstances, and may well have been his before
he left the home of his childhood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you very much for the information, Mr. Archer!
I see at once that it may very well be a strong link in the
chain.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two days later he returned to London. Mr. Palethorpe
was greatly pleased to hear that he had found so valuable
a clue.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don’t care a rap for family,</q> he said, <q>but at the same
time I suppose every man would like his daughter—</q> Here
he stopped abruptly. <q>I mean to say,</q> he said, <q>would like
to have for his son-in-law a man of good family. I grant that
it is a very stupid prejudice, still I suppose it is a general one.
You told me, I think, that your lawyer had found out that
this Sir Ralph Gilmore had only two sons, and that one of
them had died suddenly and unmarried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then in that case, you see, if you prove your identity you
would certainly be heir to the baronetcy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose so, sir. I have never given the matter any
thought. It is not rank I want, but family. Still, I might
not be heir to the baronetcy, for even supposing that my
father was really the other son, he might have had children
older than I am who remained with their grandfather.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is possible,</q> Mr. Palethorpe said, <q>though unlikely.
Why should he have left them behind him when he went out
into the world?</q>
</p>

<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>

<p>
<q>He might not have wished to bother himself with them;
he might have intended to claim them later. No one can
say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, on the whole, I should say that your chance of coming
into the baronetcy is distinctly good. It would look well,
you know—Captain Sir William Gilmore, R.N.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We mustn’t count our chickens too soon, Mr. Palethorpe,</q>
Will laughed; <q>but nevertheless I do think that the prospects
are favourable. Still, I must wait the result of the search that
my lawyer has been carrying on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you know my house is your home as long as you
like to use it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, sir! but I don’t like to intrude upon your
kindness too much, and I think that I will take a lodging
somewhere in the West End, so that I may be within easy
reach of you here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it must be as you like, lad. In some respects,
perhaps, it will be best so. I may remind you, my boy, that
it is not always wise for two young people to be constantly in
each other’s society.</q> And he laughed.
</p>

<p>
Will made no answer; he had decided to defer putting the
question until his claim was settled one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
In a few days he again called upon his lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have found out enough,</q> the latter said, <q>to be certain
that your father started from London with his violin and you,
a child of three. I have considerable hopes that we shall, ere
long, get a clue to the place where he lived while in London.
The runner has met a woman who remembers distinctly such a
man and a sick wife and child lodging in the house of a friend
of hers. The friend has moved away and she has lost sight
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>of her, but she knows some people with whom the woman
was intimate, and through them we hope to find out where
she lives.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is good news indeed,</q> Will said. <q>I had hardly
hoped that you would be so successful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a great piece of luck,</q> the lawyer said. <q>I have
written to my other agents to come home. It will be quite
sufficient to prove that he journeyed as a wandering musician
for at least fifty miles from London. Of course if further
evidence is necessary they can resume their search.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have found a clue too, sir,</q> Will said; and he then
related the discovery of the Amati, the possession of which
showed that the minstrel must at one time have been in
wealthy circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is important indeed,</q> the lawyer said, rubbing his
hands. <q>Now, sir, if we can but find out where the man
lived in London I think the chain will be complete, especially
if he was in comparatively good circumstances when he went
there. The woman will also, doubtless, be able to give a
description of his wife as well of himself, and with these
various proofs in your hand I think you may safely go down
and see Sir Ralph Gilmore, whom I shall, of course, prepare
by letter for your visit.</q>
</p>

<p>
Four days afterwards Will received a letter by an office-boy
from his lawyer asking him to call.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear sir,</q> he said as Will entered, <q>I congratulate
you most heartily. I think we have the chain complete now.
The day before yesterday the Bow Street runner came in to
say that he had found the woman, and that she was now
living out at Highgate. Yesterday I sent my clerk up to see
<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>her, and this is his report. I may tell you that nothing could
possibly be more satisfactory.</q>
</p>

<p>
The document was as follows:
</p>

<p>
<q>I called on Mrs. Giles. She is a respectable person who
lets her house in lodgings. Twenty-five years ago she had
a house in Westminster, and let the drawing-room floor to a
gentleman of the name of Gilmore. He was rather tall and
dark, and very variable in his temper. He had his wife with
him, and two months afterwards a child was born. It was
christened at St. Matthew’s. I was its god-mother, as they
seemed to have very few friends in the town. Mr. Gilmore
was out a good deal looking for employment. He used to
write of an evening, and I think made money by it. He
was very fond of his violin. Sometimes it was soft music he
played, but if he was in a bad temper he would make it shriek
and cry out, and I used to think there was a devil shut up
in it. It was awful! When he came to me he had plenty
of money, but it was not long before it began to run short,
and they lived very plain. He had all sorts of things, whips
and books and dressing-cases. These gradually went, and a
year after the child was born they moved upstairs, the rooms
being cheaper for them. A year later they occupied one room.
The wife fell ill, and the rent was often in arrears. He was
getting very shabby in his dress too. The child was three
years old when its mother died. He sold all he had left to
bury her decently, and as he had no money to pay his arrears
of rent, he gave me a silver-mounted looking-glass, which I
understood his mother had given him, and he said: <q>Don't
you sell this, but keep it, and one day or other I will come
back and redeem it.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the glass, sir,</q> the lawyer said. <q>My clerk redeemed
it after telling her that her lodger had died long ago.
<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>He went round to St. Matthew’s Church and obtained the
certificate of the child’s baptism. So I think now, Mr. Gilmore,
that we have all the evidence that can be required.
Mrs. Giles, on hearing that the child was alive, said she
would be happy to come forward and repeat what she had
said to my clerk. She seemed very interested in the affair,
and is evidently a kindly good-hearted woman. I fancy the
silver frame is of Italian workmanship, and will probably be
recognized by your grandfather. At any rate, someone there
is sure to know it. Now I think you are in a position to
go down and see him, and if you wish I will write to him
to-day. I shall not go into matters at all, and shall merely
say that the son of his son, Mr. William Gilmore, is coming
down to have an interview with him, and is provided with all
necessary proofs of his birth.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next morning Will took the coach and went down to
Radstock, in Somersetshire. He put up at the inn on his
arrival, and next morning hired a gig and drove to the house
of Sir Ralph Gilmore. It was a very fine mansion standing
in an extensive park.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bad place by any means,</q> Will said to himself; <q>I
should certainly be proud to bring Alice down here.</q>
</p>

<p>
He alighted at the entrance and sent in his name, and was
immediately shown into the library, where a tall old man was
sitting.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, sir,</q> he said stiffly, <q>that you claim to be
the son of my son, William Gilmore?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do, sir, and I think the proofs I shall give you will
satisfy you. You will understand, sir, please, before I do so,
that I have no desire whatever to make any claim upon
you; I simply wished to be recognized as a member of your
family.</q>
</p>

<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>

<p>
The old man looked him up and down, and then motioned
him to take a seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>And what has become of your father, supposing him to be
your father?</q> he asked with an evident effort.
</p>

<p>
<q>He died, sir, nearly twenty years ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man was silent for some little time, and then he
said: <q>And you, sir, what have you been doing since then?
But first, in what circumstances did he die?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the very poorest. For the last two years of his life he
earned his living and mine as a wandering fiddler.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what became of you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was brought up, sir, by a fisherman in the village in
Yorkshire in which my father died.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your manner of speech does not at all agree with that,
sir,</q> the old man said sharply.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir,</q> Will said quietly. <q>I had the good fortune to
attract the interest of the clergyman’s daughter, and she was
good enough to assist me in my education and urge me on
to study.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what is your trade or profession, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have the honour, sir, to be post-captain in His Majesty’s
navy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You a post-captain in His Majesty’s navy!</q> the old man
said scornfully. <q>Do you think to take me in with such
a tale as that? You might possibly be a very junior lieutenant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not surprised that you think so, sir. Nevertheless
I am indeed what I say. My name appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> a
month ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember now,</q> the baronet said, <q>there was a William
Gilmore appointed to that rank. The name struck me as
I glanced through the <hi rend='italic'>Gazette</hi>. I had noticed it before on
<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>several occasions, and I sighed as I thought to myself how
different must have been his career from that of my unfortunate
son. Now, sir, I beg that you will let me see your
proofs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first place, sir, there is this seal with your armorial
bearings, which was found upon him after his death.
This is a looking-glass, one which I believe was given to him
by his mother. This is the violin with which he earned his
living.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man stretched his hand out for the violin, with
tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I gave it to him,</q> he said, <q>when he was eighteen. I
thought it a great piece of extravagance at the time, but he
had such a taste for music that I thought he deserved the
best instrument I could get. The looking-glass I also recognize,
and of course the seal. Is there anything more,
sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This, sir, is the certificate of my baptism at St. Matthew’s
Church, Westminster. This is a statement of my lawyer’s
clerk, who interviewed the woman in whose house my father
and mother lived, and my mother died.</q>
</p>

<p>
The baronet took it and read it in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can produce also,</q> Will went on, as the old man laid
it down with a sigh, <q>the evidence of the lady who educated
me, and to whom I owe all the good fortune that has befallen
me. The old fisherman and his wife who brought me up are
still alive, though very old. I have means of obtaining abundant
evidence from my shipmates in the various vessels in
which I have sailed that I am the boy who left that village
at the age of fifteen, and entered as a ship’s boy in one of
His Majesty’s vessels.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you are now—?</q> the baronet asked.
</p>

<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>

<p>
<q>I am now twenty-three, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And a captain?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is so, sir. I was made a midshipman before I had
been three months on board, partly because I saved the first
lieutenant’s life, and partly because I understood enough mathematics
to take an observation. Of course I served my time as
a midshipman, and a year after passing I was made a second
lieutenant. By the death of my first lieutenant at the battle
of St. Vincent I succeeded to his post, and obtained the rank
of captain for my share in the battle of Camperdown. I
received post rank the other day when, in command of the
<name type="ship">Ethalion</name>, I brought the <name type="ship">Bellone</name>, a frigate of Admiral Bompart’s
fleet, a prize to Portsmouth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, your career has indeed been creditable and successful,
and I am proud to acknowledge, as my grandson and
heir to my title, a young gentleman who has so greatly distinguished
himself. For I do acknowledge you. The proofs
you have given me leave no doubt in my mind whatever that
you are the son of my second son. You were, of course, too
young to remember whether he ever spoke to you of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir. I was but five at the time of his death, and have
but a very faint recollection of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, of course,</q> the baronet said; <q>it was a sad
affair. Perhaps I was to blame to some extent, though I have
never thought so. Your father was, as doubtless you know,
a second son. Although somewhat eccentric in disposition,
and given to fits of passion, I had no serious occasion to complain
of him until he went up to Oxford. There he got into
a wild and dissipated set, and became the wildest and most
dissipated among them. His great talent for music was his
bane. He was continually asked out. After being two years
up there, and costing me very large sums in paying his debts,
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>he was sent down from the university. He would not turn
his hands to anything, and went up to London with the idea
of making his way somehow. He made nothing but debts,
got into various scandalous affairs, and dragged our name
through the dust. At last he came home one day and calmly
informed me that he had married a woman in a rank of life
beneath him. She was, I believe, the daughter of a horse-dealer
of very doubtful character. He also said that he wanted
£1200 to enable him to start fair. I lost my temper and said
that he should not have another pound from me. We had
a desperate quarrel, and he left the house, taking with him
all his belongings. It was four years before I took any steps
to bring him back. Then his elder brother died, and on that
I took every means to find him out. That he would ever be
a credit to me I did not even dare to hope, but at least he
could not be allowed to live in poverty. I advertised widely
and employed detectives for months, but all without result.
I have long since given up any hopes of ever seeing him again.
I am glad, indeed, to find that the title, at my death, will not
go to a distant cousin, but to my grandson, a gentleman in
every way worthy of it. You are not married, I hope?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not married, sir; but I think, if you had asked the
question, I should have replied that I was engaged, or rather
had hopes of being engaged soon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is she?</q> the baronet asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is the only daughter of a successful West Indian
planter, a man of the highest standing in the colony, who has
now returned and settled here.</q>
</p>

<p>
The baronet heaved a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is well,</q> he said; <q>and considering that you have
been all your life at sea, and have had no opportunity of
making the acquaintance of ladies of titled families, it is better
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>than I could have expected. As I do not know the procedure
in these matters I had better consult my lawyer as to the best
way of using these relics and the proofs you have given me that
you are my grandson. It may be that my recognition of you
is sufficient, but it would be as well to make sure that at my
death there will be no opposition to your succession. You
will stop here for a day or two, I hope, before going up to
town to arrange the little affair you spoke of, and I think if
your chances were good before, they will be still better now
that you are recognized as heir to a baronetcy and one of the
finest estates in England.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have never thought of that, sir. I have my profession
and nearly £40,000 of prize-money, which will enable us to
live in great comfort; and indeed I anticipate that her father
will wish us to reside with him, or, at any rate, that she shall
do so while I am away on service.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope you will not think of remaining at sea. It would
be monstrous for a man heir to £10,000 a year, besides very
large accumulations, to be knocking about the world and running
the risk of having his head taken off with a round-shot
every day. I earnestly entreat you not to dream of such a
thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will think it over. I am fond of the sea, but shall
certainly be fonder of my wife, and I feel that your wishes in
the matter should weigh with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I hope you will at least spend a portion of your
time here. It will be your future home, and it is well that
you should acquaint yourself with your duties. Besides, remember
the years that I have been a lonely man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather not give a promise, but I shall certainly
take your wishes into consideration.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I am content with that, my boy. You will stay
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>here now a few days, I hope. I have so much to hear of
your life, and of course I wish to become better acquainted
with you.</q>

<p>
Will remained a week, during which time he made a great
advance in the baronet’s affections, and the old man seemed
to gain some years of life as he walked in the garden and
drove through the country with his young heir, whom he was
delighted to introduce to everyone.
</p>

<p>
When he returned to London he at once drove over to
Dulwich.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Will, what is the result of it all?</q> Mr. Palethorpe
asked, for Will had purposely abstained from going to their
house after his last interview with his lawyer. <q>Alice has
been imagining all sorts of things: that you had been run
over, or had run away with some girl.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father! I never thought that for a moment,</q> his daughter
said indignantly, <q>though I have been very anxious, for it is
nearly a fortnight since he was here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have done a good deal in the time,</q> Will said. <q>I did
not write to you, because I wanted to tell you. I am acknowledged
as the grandson and heir to the title and estates
of Sir Ralph Gilmore.</q>
</p>

<p>
Both gave an exclamation of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
<q>And now,</q> he said, taking her hand, <q>I only need one
thing to complete my happiness, and that is, that you will
share my good fortune with me. May I hope that it will
be so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly you may, Will. I think I have loved you ever
since I was a little girl, and acknowledge that my principal
reason for inducing father to come to live in England was
that I believed I should have more chance of meeting you
again here than in Jamaica.</q>
</p>

<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>

<p>
<q>I am heartily glad, too, that it is all settled,</q> Mr. Palethorpe
said. <q>I have seen it coming on ever since you met us
the first time in London, and I may say that I have seen it with
pleasure, for there is no one to whom I would sooner trust
her happiness than you. Now I will leave you to yourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
It need hardly be said that Alice was as anxious as Sir
Ralph Gilmore that Will should quit the navy, and he consequently
yielded to their entreaties. He wrote to his grandfather
to tell him of his engagement, and the baronet wrote
back by return of post to Mr. Palethorpe, begging him to
come down with his daughter and Will for a time.
</p>

<p>
<q>I only half know him at present,</q> he said, <q>and as I understand
that just at present he will not want to leave the young
lady of his choice, you will gladden an old man if you will
all three come down to stay with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Three months later the marriage took place from the house
at Dulwich. Sir Ralph Gilmore came up for the ceremony,
and the change that the three months had effected in him was
extraordinary. He was the gayest of the party.
</p>

<p>
Among those present at the ceremony were also Will’s two
devoted friends, Dimchurch and Tom Stevens. The baronet
was greatly pleased with their affection and pride in Will, and
offered both good posts on the estate. So none of the comrades
went to sea again.
</p>

<p>
The baronet gave into Will’s hands the entire management
of the estate and house, so his death, seven years later, made
practically no difference to Will’s position. Will took to
country pursuits, and became one of the most popular landlords
in Somersetshire, while his wife was quite one of the
most popular ladies in the county. Her father, up to the time
of his death, spent most of his time down there, and they used
the house at Dulwich as their abode when they stayed in
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>London during the season. Mrs. Archer came more than once
to stay with them, as their most honoured guest. Stevens and
Dimchurch both married. The former became head-gamekeeper
on the estate, a post in which he showed great talent. The
latter took a small cottage with a bit of land just outside the
park gates, for he was able to live very comfortably on the
interest of his prize-money. He had no children of his own,
and his great pleasure was to wander about with Will’s, telling
them of their father’s adventures in the great war.
</p>

<p>
It was not till well on in the sixties that Sir William Gilmore,
captain, R.N., departed this life, a few weeks after the
death of his wife, leaving behind him a large family to carry
on the old name.

On the outbreak of the Boxer movement Rex Bateman, by a daring
stratagem, rescues some relatives from an outlying village, and conducts
them into Pekin. Then he makes his way down to Tien-tsin and joins
Admiral Seymour’s column. When the advance of this force is checked
he pushes on alone to the capital, where his courage and ready invention
are invaluable to the defenders. On the declaration of an armistice, however,
he again succeeds in eluding the Boxer bands, goes through the
storming of Tien-tsin, and marches with the allied army to Pekin.

In <hi rend='italic'>Gammon and Spinach</hi> Mr. Stewart Orr has produced a picture-book
unique of its kind. Nothing could be more droll than the situations in
which he represents the frog, the pig, the mouse, the elephant, and the
other well-known characters who appear in his pages. Little folk will
find in these pictures a source of endless delight, and the artistic skill
which they display will have a special appeal to children of an older
growth.

Clare, the hero of the story, is a boy whose mother is killed at his side by
the fall of a church during an earthquake. The kindly clergyman and his
wife, who adopt him, die while he is still very young, and he is thrown upon
the world a second time. The narrative of his wanderings is full of interest
and novelty, the boy’s unswerving honesty and his passion for children and
animals leading him into all sorts of adventures. He works on a farm, supports
a baby in an old deserted house, finds employment in a menagerie,
becomes a bank clerk, is kidnapped, and ultimately discovers his father on
board the ship to which he has been conveyed.
